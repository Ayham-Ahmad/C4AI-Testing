W3Schools Tutorial Chatbot

This project is a tutorial-maker chatbot built with Streamlit.
It crawls all tutorials from W3Schools using Crawl4AI, embeds them into a vectorstore, and applies a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to generate coding tutorials, explanations, and exercises.

Features

Crawls W3Schools tutorials with Crawl4AI

Uses embeddings + vectorstore for semantic search

RAG pipeline with LLM for generating answers

Streamlit interface for chatting with the tutor

Goal

The chatbot creates tutorials and exercises directly from W3Schools material, making it easier to learn coding concepts interactively.

Run the code:
streamlit run app.py
