It simply runs in your browser.\nIn our tutorial we will use Office 365, which can be accessed from www.office.com.\nInstall\nOnce you have successfully logged into Office through www.office.com, click on the Excel icon on the left side to enter the application:\nAfter entering the Excel application, click on the New blank workbook button to get started with a new workbook.\nEnter a name for your workbook, and hit the enter button:\nThe Excel view has columns and rows, similar to a squared math exercise book.\nDo not worry if the functionality looks overwhelming at first. You will get comfortable as you learn more in the chapters to come.\nFor now focus on the rows, columns, and the cells.\nOk. Let's make a function!\nFirst, double click the cell A1, the one that is marked with the green rectangle in the picture.\nSecond, type =1+1.\nThird, hit the enter button:\nCongratulations!

      "summary": "Overview\nThis chapter is about giving you an overview of Excel. Excel's structure is made of two pieces, the Ribbon and the Sheet.\nHave a look at the picture below. The Ribbon is marked with a red rectangle and the Sheet is marked with a yellow rectangle:\nFirst, let's start with explaining the Ribbon.\nThe Ribbon explained\nThe Ribbon provides shortcuts to Excel commands. A command is an action that allows you to make something happen. This can for example be to: insert a table, change the font size, or to change the color of a cell.\nThe Ribbon may look crowded and hard to understand at first. Don't be scared, It will become easier to navigate and use as you learn more. Most of the time we tend to use the same functionalities over again.\nThe Ribbon is made up by the App launcher, Tabs, Groups and Commands. In this section we will explain the different parts of the Ribbon.\nApp launcher\nThe App launcher icon has nine dots and is called the Office 365 navigation bar. It allows you to access the different parts of the Office 365 suite, such as Word, PowerPoint and Outlook. App launcher can be used to switch seamlessly between the Office 365 applications.\nTabs\nThe tab is a menu with sub divisions sorted into groups. The tabs allow users to quickly navigate between options of menus which display different groups of functionality.\nGroups\nThe groups are sets of related commands. The groups are separated by the thin vertical line break.\nCommands\nThe commands are the buttons that you use to do actions.\nNow, let's have a look at the Sheet. Soon you will be able to understand the relationship between the Ribbon and the Sheet, and you can make things happen.\nThe Sheet explained\nThe Sheet is a set of rows and columns. It forms the same pattern as we have in math exercise books, the rectangle boxes formed by the pattern are called cells.\nValues can be typed to cells.\nValues can be both numbers and letters:\nEach cell has its unique reference, which is its coordinates, this is where the columns and rows intersect.\nLet's break this up and explain by an example\nHave a look at the picture below. Hello world was typed in cell C4. The reference can be found by clicking on the relevant cell and seeing the reference in the Name Box to the left, which tells you that the cell's reference is C4.\nAnother way to find the reference is to first find the column, in this case C, then map that towards the row, in this case 4, which gives us the reference of C4.\nNote: The reference of the cell is its coordinates. For example, C4 has the coordinates of column C and row 4. You find the cell in the intersection of the two. The letter is always the column and the number is always the row.\nREMOVE ADS\nMultiple Sheets\nYou start with one Sheet by default when you create a new workbook. You can have many sheets in a workbook. New sheets can be added and removed. Sheets can be named to making it easier to work with data sets.\nAre you up for the challenge? Let's create two new sheets and give them useful names.\nFirst, click the plus icon, shown in the picture below, create two new sheets:\nTip: You can use the hotkey Shift + F11 to create new sheets. Try it!\nSecond, right click with your mouse on the relevant sheet and click rename:\nThird, enter useful names for the three sheets:\nIn this example we used the names Data Visualization, Data Structure and Raw Data. This is a typical structure when you are working with data.\nGood job! You have now created your first workbook with three named sheets!\nChapter Summary\nThe workbook has two main components: the Ribbon and the Sheet.\nThe Ribbon is used to navigate and access commands.\nThe Sheet is made up of columns and rows, which make cells.\nEach cell has its unique reference. You can add new sheets to your workbook and name them.\nIn the next chapters you will learn more about the sheet, formulas, ranges and functions.",

Double click the cells to type values into them. Go ahead and type:\nA1(309)\nA2(320)\nB1(39)\nB2(35)\nCompare with the picture shown below:\nNote: Type values by selecting a cell, claim it by entering the equal sign (=) and then type your value. For example =309.\nWell done! You have successfully typed values to cells and now we can use them to create formulas.\nHere is how to do it, step by step.\nSelect the cell C1\nType the equal sign (=)\nLeft click on A1, the cell that has the (309) value\nType the minus sign (-)\nLeft click on B2, the cell that has the (35) value\nHit enter\nTip: The formula can be typed directly without clicking the cells. The typed formula would be the same as the value in C1 (=A1-B2).\nThe result after hitting the enter button is C1(274).

      "summary": "Ranges\nRange is an important part of Excel because it allows you to work with selections of cells.\nThere are four different operations for selection;\nSelecting a cell\nSelecting multiple cells\nSelecting a column\nSelecting a row\nBefore having a look at the different operations for selection, we will introduce the Name Box.\nThe Name Box\nThe Name Box shows you the reference of which cell or range you have selected. It can also be used to select cells or ranges by typing their values.\nYou will learn more about the Name Box later in this chapter.\nSelecting a Cell\nCells are selected by clicking them with the left mouse button or by navigating to them with the keyboard arrows.\nIt is easiest to use the mouse to select cells.\nTo select cell A1, click on it:\nSelecting Multiple Cells\nMore than one cell can be selected by pressing and holding down CTRL or Command and left clicking the cells. Once finished with selecting, you can let go of CTRL or Command.\nLets try an example: Select the cells A1, A7, C1, C7 and B4.\nDid it look like the picture below?\nSelecting a Column\nColumns are selected by left clicking it. This will select all cells in the sheet related to the column.\nTo select column A, click on the letter A in the column bar:\nSelecting a Row\nRows are selected by left clicking it. This will select all the cells in the sheet related to that row.\nTo select row 1, click on its number in the row bar:\nREMOVE ADS\nSelecting the Entire Sheet\nThe entire spreadsheet can be selected by clicking the triangle in the top-left corner of the spreadsheet:\nNow, the whole spreadsheet is selected:\nNote: You can also select the entire spreadsheet by pressing Ctrl+A for Windows, or Cmd+A for MacOS.\nSelection of Ranges\nSelection of cell ranges has many use areas and it is one of the most important concepts of Excel. Do not think too much about how it is used with values. You will learn about this in a later chapter. For now let's focus on how to select ranges.\nThere are two ways to select a range of cells\nName Box\nDrag to mark a range.\nThe easiest way is drag and mark. Let's keep it simple and start there.\nHow to drag and mark a range, step-by-step:\nSelect a cell\nLeft click it and hold the mouse button down\nMove your mouse pointer over the range that you want selected. The range that is marked will turn grey.\nLet go of the mouse button when you have marked the range\nLet's have a look at an example for how to mark the range A1:E10.\nNote: You will learn about why the range is called A1:E10 after this example.\nSelect cell A1:\nPress and hold A1 with the left mouse button. Move to the mouse pointer to mark the selection range. The grey area helps us to see the covered range.\nLet go of the left mouse button when you have marked the range A1:E10:\nYou have successfully selected the range A1:E10. Well done!\nThe second way to select a range is to enter the range values in the Name Box. The range is set by first entering the cell reference for the top left corner, then the bottom right corner. The range is made using those two as coordinates. That is why the cell range has the reference of two cells and the : in between.\nTop left corner reference : Right bottom corner reference\nThe range shown in the picture has the value of A1:E10:\nThe best way for now is to use the drag and mark method as it is easier and more visual.\nIn the next chapter you will learn about filling and how this applies to the ranges that we have just learned.\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExcel Exercise:\nType the cell reference for Column A, Row 1:\nStart the Exercise",

      "title": "Excel Fill",
      "summary": "Filling\nFilling makes your life easier and is used to fill ranges with values, so that you do not have to type manual entries.\nFilling can be used for:\nCopying\nSequences\nDates\nFunctions (*)\nFor now, do not think of functions. We will cover that in a later chapter.\nHow To Fill\nFilling is done by selecting a cell, clicking the fill icon and selecting the range using drag and mark while holding the left mouse button down.\nThe fill icon is found in the bottom right corner of the cell and has the icon of a small square. Once you hover over it your mouse pointer will change its icon to a thin cross.\nClick the fill icon and hold down the left mouse button, drag and mark the range that you want to cover.\nIn this example, cell A1 was selected and the range A1:A10 was marked.\nNow that we have learned how to fill. Let's look into how to copy with the fill function.\nFill Copies\nFilling can be used for copying. It can be used for both numbers and words.\nLet's have a look at numbers first.\nIn this example we have typed the value A1(1):\nFilling the range A1:A10 creates ten copies of 1:\nThe same principle goes for text.\nIn this example we have typed A1(Hello World).\nFilling the range A1:A10 creates ten copies of \"Hello World\":\nNow you have learned how to fill and to use it for copying both numbers and words. Let's have a look at sequences.\nREMOVE ADS\nFill Sequences\nFilling can be used to create sequences. A sequence is an order or a pattern. We can use the filling function to continue the order that has been set.\nSequences can for example be used on numbers and dates.\nLet's start with learning how to count from 1 to 10.\nThis is different from the last example because this time we do not want to copy, but to count from 1 to 10.\nStart with typing A1(1):\nFirst we will show an example which does not work, then we will do a working one. Ready?\nLets type the value (1) into the cell A2, which is what we have in A1. Now we have the same values in both A1 and A2.\nLet's use the fill function from A1:A10 to see what happens. Remember to mark both values before you fill the range.\nWhat happened is that we got the same values as we did with copying. This is because the fill function assumes that we want to create copies as we had two of the same values in both the cells A1(1) and A2(1).\nChange the value of A2(1) to A2(2). We now have two different values in the cells A1(1) and A2(2). Now, fill A1:A10 again. Remember to mark both the values (holding down shift) before you fill the range:\nCongratulations! You have now counted from 1 to 10.\nThe fill function understands the pattern typed in the cells and continues it for us.\nThat is why it created copies when we had entered the value (1) in both cells, as it saw no pattern. When we entered (1) and (2) in the cells it was able to understand the pattern and that the next cell A3 should be (3).\nLet's create another sequence. Type A1(2) and A2(4):\nNow, fill A1:A10:\nIt counts from 2 to 20 in the range A1:A10.\nThis is because we created an order with A1(2) and A2(4).\nThen it fills the next cells, A3(6), A4(8), A5(10) and so on. The fill function understands the pattern and helps us continue it.\nSequence of Dates\nThe fill function can also be used to fill dates.\nNote: The date format depends on you regional language settings.\nFor example 14.03.2023 vs. 3/14/2023.\nTest it by typing A1(29.07.2021):\nAnd fill the range A1:A10:\nThe fill function has filled 10 days from A1(29.07.2021) to A10(07.08.2021).\nNote that it switched from July to August in cell A4. It knows the calendar and will count real dates.\nCombining Words and Letters\nWords and letters can also be combined.\nType A1(Hello 1) and A2(Hello 2):\nNext, fill A1:A10 to see what happens:\nThe result is that it counts from A1(Hello 1) to A10(Hello 10). Only the numbers have changed.\nIt recognised the pattern of the numbers and continued it for us. Words and numbers can be combined, as long as you use a recognizable pattern for the numbers.\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExcel Exercise:\nComplete the sequence of numbers:\nStart the Exercise",

      "summary": "Formulas\nA formula in Excel is used to do mathematical calculations. Formulas always start with the equal sign (=) typed in the cell, followed by your calculation.\nFormulas can be used for calculations such as:\n=1+1\n=2*2\n=4/2=2\nIt can also be used to calculate values using cells as input.\nLet's have a look at an example.\nType or copy the following values:\nNow we want to do a calculation with those values.\nStep by step:\nSelect C1 and type (=)\nLeft click A1\nType (+)\nLeft click A2\nPress enter\nYou got it! You have successfully calculated A1(2) + A2(4) = C1(6).\nNote: Using cells to make calculations is an important part of Excel and you will use this alot as you learn.\nLets change from addition to multiplication, by replacing the (+) with a (*). It should now be =A1*A2, press enter to see what happens.\nYou got C1(8), right? Well done!\nExcel is great in this way. It allows you to add values to cells and make you do calculations on them.\nNow, try to change the multiplication (*) to subtraction (-) and dividing (/).\nDelete all values in the sheet after you have tried the different combinations.\nLet's add new data for the next example, where we will help the Pokemon trainers to count their Pokeballs.\nType or copy the following values:\nThe data explained:\nColumn A: Pokemon Trainers\nRow 1: Types of Pokeballs\nRange B2:D4: Amount of Pokeballs, Great balls and Ultra balls\nNote: It is important to practice reading data to understand its context. In this example you should focus on the trainers and their Pokeballs, which have three different types: Pokeball, Great ball and Ultra ball.\nREMOVE ADS\nLet's help Iva to count her Pokeballs. You find Iva in A2(Iva). The values in row 2 B2(2), C2(3), D2(1) belong to her.\nCount the Pokeballs, step by step:\nSelect cell E2 and type (=)\nLeft click B2\nType (+)\nLeft click C2\nType (+)\nLeft click D2\nHit enter\nDid you get the value E2(6)? Good job! You have helped Iva to count her Pokeballs.\nNow, let's help Liam and Adora with counting theirs.\nDo you remember the fill function that we learned about earlier? It can be used to continue calculations sidewards, downwards and upwards. Let's try it!\nLets use the fill function to continue the formula, step by step:\nSelect E2\nFill E2:E4\nThat is cool, right? The fill function continued the calculation that you used for Iva and was able to understand that you wanted to count the cells in the next rows as well.\nNow we have counted the Pokeballs for all three; Iva(6), Liam(12) and Adora(15).\nLet's see how many Pokeballs Iva, Liam and Adora have in total.\nThe total is called SUM in Excel.\nThere are two ways to calculate the SUM.\nAdding cells\nSUM function\nExcel has many pre-made functions available for you to use. The SUM function is one of the most used ones. You will learn more about functions in a later chapter.\nLet's try both approaches.\nNote: You can navigate to the cells with your keyboard arrows instead of left clicking them. Try it!\nSum by adding cells, step by step:\nSelect cell E5, and type =\nLeft click E2\nType (+)\nLeft click E3\nType (+)\nLeft click E4\nHit enter\nThe result is E5(33).\nLet's try the SUM function.\nRemember to delete the values that you currently have in E5.\nSUM function, step by step:\nType E5(=)\nWrite SUM\nDouble click SUM in the menu\nMark the range E2:E4\nHit enter\nGreat job! You have successfully calculated the SUM using the SUM function.\nIva, Liam and Adora have 33 Pokeballs in total.\nLet's change a value to see what happens. Type B2(7):\nThe value in cell B2 was changed from 2 to 7. Notice that the formulas are doing calculations when we change the value in the cells, and the SUM is updated from 33 to 38. It allows us to change values that are used by the formulas, and the calculations remain.\nChapter Summary\nValues used in formulas can be typed directly and by using cells. The formula updates the result if you change the value of cells, which is used in the formula. The fill function can be used to continue your formulas upwards, downwards and sidewards. Excel has pre-built functions, such as SUM.\nIn the next chapter you will learn about relative and absolute references.\nTest Yourself With Exercises\nExcel Exercise:\nComplete the Excel formula:\nStart the Exercise",
