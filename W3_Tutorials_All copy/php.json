It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.\nThink of variables as containers for storing data.\nPHP Variables\nA variable can have a short name (like $x and $y) or a more descriptive name ($age, $carname, $total_volume).\nRules for PHP variables:\nA variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable\nA variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\nA variable name cannot start with a number\nA variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\nVariable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)\nRemember that PHP variable names are case-sensitive!\nREMOVE ADS\nOutput Variables\nThe PHP echo statement is often used to output data to the screen.\nThe following example will show how to output text and a variable:\nExample\nThe following example will produce the same output as the example above:\nExample\nThe following example will output the sum of two variables:\nExample\nNote: You will learn more about the echo statement and how to output data to the screen in the PHP Echo/Print chapter.\nPHP is a Loosely Typed Language\nIn the example above, notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.\nPHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value. Since the data types are not set in a strict sense, you can do things like adding a string to an integer without causing an error.\nIn PHP 7, type declarations were added. This gives an option to specify the data type expected when declaring a function, and by enabling the strict requirement, it will throw a \"Fatal Error\" on a type mismatch.\nYou will learn more about strict and non-strict requirements, and data type declarations in the PHP Functions chapter.\nVariable Types\nPHP has no command for declaring a variable, and the data type depends on the value of the variable.\nExample\nPHP supports the following data types:\nString\nInteger\nFloat (floating point numbers - also called double)\nBoolean\nArray\nObject\nNULL\nResource\nGet the Type\nTo get the data type of a variable, use the var_dump() function.\nExample\nThe var_dump() function returns the data type and the value:\nExample\nSee what var_dump() returns for other data types:\nAssign String to a Variable\nAssigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:\nExample\nString variables can be declared either by using double or single quotes, but you should be aware of the differences. Learn more about the differences in the PHP Strings chapter.\nAssign Multiple Values\nYou can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:\nExample\nAll three variables get the value \"Fruit\":",

The index holds the name of the variable. This array is also accessible from within functions and can be used to update global variables directly.\nThe example above can be rewritten like this:\nExample\nPHP The static Keyword\nNormally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job.\nTo do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable:\nExample\nThen, each time the function is called, that variable will still have the information it contained from the last time the function was called.\nNote: The variable is still local to the function.",

The var_dump() function returns the data type and value:\nExample\nREMOVE ADS\nPHP Float\nA float (floating point number) is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.\nIn the following example $x is a float. The var_dump() function returns the data type and value:\nExample\nPHP Boolean\nA Boolean represents two possible states: TRUE or FALSE.\nExample\nBooleans are often used in conditional testing.\nYou will learn more about conditional testing in the PHP If...Else chapter.\nPHP Array\nAn array stores multiple values in one single variable.\nIn the following example $cars is an array. The var_dump() function returns the data type and value:\nExample\nYou will learn a lot more about arrays in later chapters of this tutorial.\nPHP Object\nClasses and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.\nA class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.\nWhen the individual objects are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties.\nLet's assume we have a class named Car that can have properties like model, color, etc. We can define variables like $model, $color, and so on, to hold the values of these properties.\nWhen the individual objects (Volvo, BMW, Toyota, etc.) are created, they inherit all the properties and behaviors from the class, but each object will have different values for the properties.\nIf you create a __construct() function, PHP will automatically call this function when you create an object from a class.\nExample\nDo not worry if you do not understand the PHP Object syntax, you will learn more about that in the PHP Classes/Objects chapter.\nPHP NULL Value\nNull is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.\nA variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it.\nTip: If a variable is created without a value, it is automatically assigned a value of NULL.\nVariables can also be emptied by setting the value to NULL:\nExample\nChange Data Type\nIf you assign an integer value to a variable, the type will automatically be an integer.\nIf you assign a string to the same variable, the type will change to a string:\nExample\nIf you want to change the data type of an existing variable, but not by changing the value, you can use casting.\nCasting allows you to change data type on variables:\nExample\nYou will learn more about casting in the PHP Casting Chapter.\nPHP Resource\nThe special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a reference to functions and resources external to PHP.\nA common example of using the resource data type is a database call.\nWe will not talk about the resource type here, since it is an advanced topic.",

A value greater (or lower) than this, will be stored as float, because it exceeds the limit of an integer.\nNote: Another important thing to know is that even if 4 * 2.5 is 10, the result is stored as float, because one of the operands is a float (2.5).\nHere are some rules for integers:\nAn integer must have at least one digit\nAn integer must NOT have a decimal point\nAn integer can be either positive or negative\nIntegers can be specified in three formats: decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base 16 - prefixed with 0x), octal (base 8 - prefixed with 0) or binary (base 2 - prefixed with 0b)\nPHP has the following predefined constants for integers:\nPHP_INT_MAX - The largest integer supported\nPHP_INT_MIN - The smallest integer supported\nPHP_INT_SIZE -  The size of an integer in bytes\nREMOVE ADS\nPHP Floats\nThe PHP is_float() function is used to check if the type of a variable is float.\nA float is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form: 2.0, 256.4, 10.358, 7.64E+5, 5.56E-5 are all floats.\nExample\nCheck if a variable is of type float:\nThe float data type can commonly store a value up to 1.7976931348623E+308 (platform dependent), and have a maximum precision of 14 digits.\nPHP has the following predefined constants for floats (from PHP 7.2):\nPHP_FLOAT_MAX - The largest representable floating point number\nPHP_FLOAT_MIN - The smallest representable positive floating point number\nPHP_FLOAT_DIG - The number of decimal digits that can be rounded into a float and back without precision loss\nPHP_FLOAT_EPSILON - The smallest representable positive number x, so that x + 1.0 != 1.0\nPHP Infinity\nThe PHP is_finite() function checks whether a value is finite or not.\nA value is finite if it is within the allowed range for a PHP float on this platform.\nThe PHP is_infinite() function checks whether a value is infinite or not.\nThe value is infinite if it is outside the allowed range for a PHP float on this platform.\nExample\nCheck if a numeric value is infinite:\nPHP NaN\nNaN stands for Not a Number.\nNaN is used for impossible mathematical operations.\nThe PHP is_nan() function is used to check if a value is not a number.\nExample\nInvalid calculation will return a NaN value:\nPHP Numerical Strings\nThe PHP is_numeric() function is used to check whether a variable is a number or a numeric string.\nThis function returns true if the variable is a number or a numeric string, false otherwise.\nExample\nCheck if the variable is numeric:\nNote: From PHP 7.0: The is_numeric() function will return FALSE for numeric strings in hexadecimal form (e.g. 0xf4c3b00c), as they are no longer considered as numeric strings.\nPHP Casting Strings and Floats to Integers\nSometimes you need to cast a numerical value into another data type.\nThe (int), (integer), and intval() functions are often used to convert a value to an integer.\nExample\nCast float and string to integer:\nLearn more about casting in the PHP Casting chapter.",

Function names are NOT case-sensitive.\nTip: Give the function a name that reflects what the function does!\nCall a Function\nTo call the function, just write its name followed by parentheses ():\nExample\nIn our example, we create a function named myMessage().\nThe opening curly brace { indicates the beginning of the function code, and the closing curly brace } indicates the end of the function.\nThe function outputs \"Hello world!\".\nREMOVE ADS\nPHP Function Arguments\nInformation can be passed to functions through arguments. An argument is just like a variable.\nArguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.\nThe following example has a function with one argument ($fname). When the familyName() function is called, we also pass along a name, e.g. (\"Jani\"), and the name is used inside the function, which outputs several different first names, but an equal last name:\nExample\nThe following example has a function with two arguments ($fname, $year):\nExample\nPHP Default Argument Value\nThe following example shows how to use a default parameter. If we call the function setHeight() without arguments it takes the default value as argument:\nExample\nPHP Functions - Returning values\nTo let a function return a value, use the return statement:\nExample\nPassing Arguments by Reference\nIn PHP, arguments are usually passed by value, which means that a copy of the value is used in the function and the variable that was passed into the function cannot be changed.\nWhen a function argument is passed by reference, changes to the argument also change the variable that was passed in. To turn a function argument into a reference, the & operator is used:\nExample\nUse a pass-by-reference argument to update a variable:\nVariable Number of Arguments\nBy using the ... operator in front of the function parameter, the function accepts an unknown number of arguments. This is also called a variadic function.\nThe variadic function argument becomes an array.\nExample\nA function that do not know how many arguments it will get:\nYou can only have one argument with variable length, and it has to be the last argument.\nExample\nThe variadic argument must be the last argument:\nIf the variadic argument is not the last argument, you will get an error.\nExample\nHaving the ... operator on the first of two arguments, will raise an error:\nPHP is a Loosely Typed Language\nIn the examples above, notice that we did not have to tell PHP which data type the variable is.\nPHP automatically associates a data type to the variable, depending on its value. Since the data types are not set in a strict sense, you can do things like adding a string to an integer without causing an error.\nIn PHP 7, type declarations were added. This gives us an option to specify the expected data type when declaring a function, and by adding the strict declaration, it will throw a \"Fatal Error\" if the data type mismatches.\nIn the following example we try to send both a number and a string to the function without using strict:\nExample\nTo specify strict we need to set declare(strict_types=1);. This must be on the very first line of the PHP file.\nIn the following example we try to send both a number and a string to the function, but here we have added the strict declaration:\nExample\nThe strict declaration forces things to be used in the intended way.\nPHP Return Type Declarations\nPHP 7 also supports Type Declarations for the return statement. Like with the type declaration for function arguments, by enabling the strict requirement, it will throw a \"Fatal Error\" on a type mismatch.\nTo declare a type for the function return, add a colon ( : ) and the type right before the opening curly ( { )bracket when declaring the function.\nIn the following example we specify the return type for the function:\nExample\nYou can specify a different return type, than the argument types, but make sure the return is the correct type:\nExample",

When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.\nA regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.\nRegular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.\nSyntax\nIn PHP, regular expressions are strings composed of delimiters, a pattern and optional modifiers.\nIn the example above, / is the delimiter, w3schools is the pattern that is being searched for, and i is a modifier that makes the search case-insensitive.\nThe delimiter can be any character that is not a letter, number, backslash or space. The most common delimiter is the forward slash (/), but when your pattern contains forward slashes it is convenient to choose other delimiters such as # or ~.\nRegular Expression Functions\nPHP provides a variety of functions that allow you to use regular expressions.\nThe most common functions are:\nUsing preg_match()\nThe preg_match() function will tell you whether a string contains matches of a pattern.\nExampleGet your own PHP Server\nUse a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for \"w3schools\" in a string:\nUsing preg_match_all()\nThe preg_match_all() function will tell you how many matches were found for a pattern in a string.\nExample\nUse a regular expression to do a case-insensitive count of the number of occurrences of \"ain\" in a string:\nUsing preg_replace()\nThe preg_replace() function will replace all of the matches of the pattern in a string with another string.\nExample\nUse a case-insensitive regular expression to replace Microsoft with W3Schools in a string:\nREMOVE ADS\nRegular Expression Modifiers\nModifiers can change how a search is performed.\nRegular Expression Patterns\nBrackets are used to find a range of characters:\nMetacharacters\nMetacharacters are characters with a special meaning:\nQuantifiers\nQuantifiers define quantities:\nNote: If your expression needs to search for one of the special characters you can use a backslash ( \\ ) to escape them. For example, to search for one or more question marks you can use the following expression: $pattern = '/\\?+/';\nGrouping\nYou can use parentheses ( ) to apply quantifiers to entire patterns. They also can be used to select parts of the pattern to be used as a match.\nExample\nUse grouping to search for the word \"banana\" by looking for ba followed by two instances of na:\nComplete RegExp Reference\nFor a complete reference, go to our Complete PHP Regular Expression Reference.\nThe reference contains descriptions and examples of all Regular Expression functions.",

Proper validation of form data is important to protect your form from hackers and spammers!\nREMOVE ADS\nGET vs. POST\nBoth GET and POST create an array (e.g. array( key1 => value1, key2 => value2, key3 => value3, ...)). This array holds key/value pairs, where keys are the names of the form controls and values are the input data from the user.\nBoth GET and POST are treated as $_GET and $_POST. These are superglobals, which means that they are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, class or file without having to do anything special.\n$_GET is an array of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters.\n$_POST is an array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method.\nWhen to use GET?\nInformation sent from a form with the GET method is visible to everyone (all variable names and values are displayed in the URL). GET also has limits on the amount of information to send. The limitation is about 2000 characters. However, because the variables are displayed in the URL, it is possible to bookmark the page. This can be useful in some cases.\nGET may be used for sending non-sensitive data.\nNote: GET should NEVER be used for sending passwords or other sensitive information!\nWhen to use POST?\nInformation sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others (all names/values are embedded within the body of the HTTP request) and has no limits on the amount of information to send.\nMoreover POST supports advanced functionality such as support for multi-part binary input while uploading files to server.\nHowever, because the variables are not displayed in the URL, it is not possible to bookmark the page.\nDevelopers prefer POST for sending form data.\nNext, lets see how we can process PHP forms the secure way!",

Proper validation of form data is important to protect your form from hackers and spammers!\nThe HTML form we will be working at in these chapters, contains various input fields: required and optional text fields, radio buttons, and a submit button:\nThe validation rules for the form above are as follows:\nFirst we will look at the plain HTML code for the form:\nREMOVE ADS\nText Fields\nThe name, email, and website fields are text input elements, and the comment field is a textarea.\nThe HTML code looks like this:\nRadio Buttons\nThe gender fields are radio buttons and the HTML code looks like this:\nThe Form Element\nThe HTML code of the form looks like this:\nWhen the form is submitted, the form data is sent with method=\"post\".\nWhat is the $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"] variable?\n\nThe $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"] is a super global variable that returns the filename of the currently executing script.\nSo, the $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"] sends the submitted form data to the page itself, instead of jumping to a different page. This way, the user will get error messages on the same page as the form.\nWhat is the htmlspecialchars() function?\n\nThe htmlspecialchars() function converts special characters into HTML entities. This means that it will replace HTML characters like < and > with &lt; and &gt;. This prevents attackers from exploiting the code by injecting HTML or Javascript code (Cross-site Scripting attacks) in forms.\nWarning!\nThe $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"] variable can be used by hackers!\nIf PHP_SELF is used in your page then a user can enter a slash / and then some Cross Site Scripting (XSS) commands to execute.\nCross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in Web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side script into Web pages viewed by other users.\nAssume we have the following form in a page named \"test_form.php\":\nNow, if a user enters the normal URL in the address bar like \"http://www.example.com/test_form.php\", the above code will be translated to:\nSo far, so good.\nHowever, consider that a user enters the following URL in the address bar:\nIn this case, the above code will be translated to:\nThis code adds a script tag and an alert command. And when the page loads, the JavaScript code will be executed (the user will see an alert box). This is just a simple and harmless example how the PHP_SELF variable can be exploited.\nBe aware of that any JavaScript code can be added inside the <script> tag! A hacker can redirect the user to a file on another server, and that file can hold malicious code that can alter the global variables or submit the form to another address to save the user data, for example.\nHow To Avoid $_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"] Exploits?\n$_SERVER[\"PHP_SELF\"] exploits can be avoided by using the htmlspecialchars() function.\nThe form code should look like this:\nThe htmlspecialchars() function converts special characters to HTML entities. Now if the user tries to exploit the PHP_SELF variable, it will result in the following output:\nThe exploit attempt fails, and no harm is done!\nValidate Form Data With PHP\nThe first thing we will do is to pass all variables through PHP's htmlspecialchars() function.\nWhen we use the htmlspecialchars() function; then if a user tries to submit the following in a text field:\n- this would not be executed, because it would be saved as HTML escaped code, like this:\nThe code is now safe to be displayed on a page or inside an e-mail.\nWe will also do two more things when the user submits the form:\nStrip unnecessary characters (extra space, tab, newline) from the user input data (with the PHP trim() function)\nRemove backslashes \\ from the user input data (with the PHP stripslashes() function)\nThe next step is to create a function that will do all the checking for us (which is much more convenient than writing the same code over and over again).\nWe will name the function test_input().\nNow, we can check each $_POST variable with the test_input() function, and the script looks like this:\nExampleGet your own PHP Server\nNotice that at the start of the script, we check whether the form has been submitted using $_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"]. If the REQUEST_METHOD is POST, then the form has been submitted - and it should be validated. If it has not been submitted, skip the validation and display a blank form.\nHowever, in the example above, all input fields are optional. The script works fine even if the user does not enter any data.\nThe next step is to make input fields required and create error messages if needed.",

Otherwise, in case of FrameWork, CMS, or a complex PHP application coding, always use the require statement to include a key file to the flow of execution. This will help avoid compromising your application's security and integrity, just in-case one key file is accidentally missing.\nIncluding files saves a lot of work. This means that you can create a standard header, footer, or menu file for all your web pages. Then, when the header needs to be updated, you can only update the header include file.\nSyntax\nPHP include Examples\nExample 1\nAssume we have a standard footer file called \"footer.php\", that looks like this:\nTo include the footer file in a page, use the include statement:\nExampleGet your own PHP Server\nREMOVE ADS\nExample 2\nAssume we have a standard menu file called \"menu.php\":\nAll pages in the Web site should use this menu file.

But on the internet there is one problem: the web server does not know who you are or what you do, because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.\nSession variables solve this problem by storing user information to be used across multiple pages (e.g. username, favorite color, etc). By default, session variables last until the user closes the browser.\nSo; Session variables hold information about one single user, and are available to all pages in one application.\nTip: If you need a permanent storage, you may want to store the data in a database.\nStart a PHP Session\nA session is started with the session_start() function.\nSession variables are set with the PHP global variable: $_SESSION.\nNow, let's create a new page called \"demo_session1.php\". In this page, we start a new PHP session and set some session variables:\nExampleGet your own PHP Server\nNote: The session_start() function must be the very first thing in your document. Before any HTML tags.\nREMOVE ADS\nGet PHP Session Variable Values\nNext, we create another page called \"demo_session2.php\". From this page, we will access the session information we set on the first page (\"demo_session1.php\").\nNotice that session variables are not passed individually to each new page, instead they are retrieved from the session we open at the beginning of each page (session_start()).\nAlso notice that all session variable values are stored in the global $_SESSION variable:\nExample\nAnother way to show all the session variable values for a user session is to run the following code:\nExample\nHow does it work? How does it know it's me?\n\nMost sessions set a user-key on the user's computer that looks something like this: 765487cf34ert8dede5a562e4f3a7e12. Then, when a session is opened on another page, it scans the computer for a user-key. If there is a match, it accesses that session, if not, it starts a new session.\nModify a PHP Session Variable\nTo change a session variable, just overwrite it:\nExample\nDestroy a PHP Session\nTo remove all global session variables and destroy the session, use session_unset() and session_destroy():\nExample",

However, this extension was deprecated in 2012.\nShould I Use MySQLi or PDO?\nIf you need a short answer, it would be \"Whatever you like\".\nBoth MySQLi and PDO have their advantages:\nPDO will work on 12 different database systems, whereas MySQLi will only work with MySQL databases.\nSo, if you have to switch your project to use another database, PDO makes the process easy. You only have to change the connection string and a few queries. With MySQLi, you will need to rewrite the entire code - queries included.\nBoth are object-oriented, but MySQLi also offers a procedural API.\nBoth support Prepared Statements. Prepared Statements protect from SQL injection, and are very important for web application security.\nMySQL Examples in Both MySQLi and PDO Syntax\nIn this, and in the following chapters we demonstrate three ways of working with PHP and MySQL:\nMySQLi (object-oriented)\nMySQLi (procedural)\nPDO\nMySQLi Installation\nFor Linux and Windows: The MySQLi extension is automatically installed in most cases, when php5 mysql package is installed.\nFor installation details, go to: http://php.net/manual/en/mysqli.installation.php\nPDO Installation\nFor installation details, go to: http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php\nREMOVE ADS\nOpen a Connection to MySQL\nBefore we can access data in the MySQL database, we need to be able to connect to the server:\nExample (MySQLi Object-Oriented)Get your own PHP Server\nNote on the object-oriented example above:\n$connect_error was broken until PHP 5.2.9 and 5.3.0. If you need to ensure compatibility with PHP versions prior to 5.2.9 and 5.3.0, use the following code instead:\n\n// Check connection\nif (mysqli_connect_error()) {\ndie(\"Database connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n}\nExample (MySQLi Procedural)\nExample (PDO)\nNote: In the PDO example above we have also specified a database (myDB). PDO require a valid database to connect to. If no database is specified, an exception is thrown.\nTip: A great benefit of PDO is that it has an exception class to handle any problems that may occur in our database queries. If an exception is thrown within the try{ } block, the script stops executing and flows directly to the first catch(){ } block.\nClose the Connection\nThe connection will be closed automatically when the script ends.

Certain values are left unspecified, called parameters (labeled \"?\"). Example: INSERT INTO MyGuests VALUES(?, ?, ?)\nThe database parses, compiles, and performs query optimization on the SQL statement template, and stores the result without executing it\nExecute: At a later time, the application binds the values to the parameters, and the database executes the statement. The application may execute the statement as many times as it wants with different values\nCompared to executing SQL statements directly, prepared statements have three main advantages:\nPrepared statements reduce parsing time as the preparation on the query is done only once (although the statement is executed multiple times)\nBound parameters minimize bandwidth to the server as you need send only the parameters each time, and not the whole query\nPrepared statements are very useful against SQL injections, because parameter values, which are transmitted later using a different protocol, need not be correctly escaped.

This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.\nClassic web pages, (which do not use AJAX) must reload the entire page if the content should change.\nExamples of applications using AJAX: Google Maps, Gmail, Youtube, and Facebook tabs.\nHow AJAX Works\nAJAX is Based on Internet Standards\nAJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:\nXMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server)\nJavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information)\nCSS (to style the data)\nXML (often used as the format for transferring data)\nAJAX applications are browser- and platform-independent!\nGoogle Suggest\nAJAX was made popular in 2005 by Google, with Google Suggest.\nGoogle Suggest is using AJAX to create a very dynamic web interface: When you start typing in Google's search box, a JavaScript sends the letters off to a server and the server returns a list of suggestions.\nStart Using AJAX Today\nIn our PHP tutorial, we will demonstrate how AJAX can update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

PHP checks what algorithms are available and what algorithms to use when it is installed.\nThe salt parameter is optional. However, crypt() creates a weak password without the salt. Make sure to specify a strong enough salt for better security.\nThere are some constants that are used together with the crypt() function. The value of these constants are set by PHP when it is installed.\nConstants:\n[CRYPT_STD_DES] - Standard DES-based hash with two character salt from the alphabet \"./0-9A-Za-z\". Using invalid characters in the salt will cause this function to fail.\n[CRYPT_EXT_DES] - Extended DES-based hash with a nine character salt consisting of an underscore followed by 4 bytes of iteration count and 4 bytes of salt. These are encoded as printable characters, 6 bits per character, least significant character first. The values 0 to 63 are encoded as \"./0-9A-Za-z\". Using invalid characters in the salt will cause the function to fail.\n[CRYPT_MD5] - MD5 hashing with a 12 character salt starting with $1$\n[CRYPT_BLOWFISH] - Blowfish hashing with a salt starting with $2a$, $2x$, or $2y$, a two digit cost parameters \"$\", and 22 characters from the alphabet \"./0-9A-Za-z\". Using characters outside of the alphabet will cause this function to return a zero-length string. The \"$\" parameter is the base-2 logarithm of the iteration count for the underlying Blowfish-bashed hashing algorithmeter and must be in range 04-31. Values outside this range will cause the function to fail.\n[CRYPT_SHA_256] - SHA-256 hash with a 16 character salt starting with $5$. If the salt string starts with \"rounds=<N>$\", the numeric value of N is used to indicate how many times the hashing loop should be executed, much like the cost parameter on Blowfish. The default number of rounds is 5000, there is a minimum of 1000 and a maximum of 999,999,999. Any selection of N outside this range will be truncated to the nearest limit.\n[CRYPT_SHA_512] - SHA-512 hash with a 16 character salt starting with $6$. If the salt string starts with \"rounds=<N>$\", the numeric value of N is used to indicate how many times the hashing loop should be executed, much like the cost parameter on Blowfish. The default number of rounds is 5000, there is a minimum of 1000 and a maximum of 999,999,999. Any selection of N outside this range will be truncated to the nearest limit.\nOn systems where this function supports multiple algorithms, the constants above are set to \"1\" if supported and \"0\" otherwise.\nNote: There is no decrypt function. The crypt() function uses a one-way algorithm.\nSyntax\nParameter Values\nREMOVE ADS\nTechnical Details\nMore Examples\nExampleGet your own PHP Server\nIn this example we will test the different algorithms:\nThe output of the code above could be (depending on the operating system):",

When an event occurs, it calls a specified function to handle it.\nExpat is a non-validating parser, and ignores any DTDs linked to a document. However, if the document is not well formed it will end with an error message.\nBecause it is an event-based, non validating parser, Expat is fast and well suited for web applications.\nThe XML parser functions lets you create XML parsers and define handlers for XML events.\nInstallation\nThe XML functions are part of the PHP core.
