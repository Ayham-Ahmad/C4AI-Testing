  "description": "ASP stands for Active Server Pages ASP is a development framework for building web pages. ASP supports many different development models: ASP and ASP.NET are server side technologies. Both technologies enable computer code to be executed by an Internet server. When a browser requests an ASP or ASP.NET file, the ASP engine reads the file, executes any code in the file, and returns the result to the browser. ASP (aka Classic ASP) was introduced in 1998 as Microsoft's first server side scripting language. Classic ASP pages have the file extension .asp and are normally written in VBScript. ASP.NET was released in 2002 as a successor to Classic ASP. ASP.NET pages have the extension .aspx and are normally written in C# (C sharp). ASP.NET 4.6 is the latest official version of ASP.NET. ASP.NET 5 was expected to be an important redesign of ASP.NET. However, the development of ASP.NET 5 was stopped in favor of ASP.NET Core.",

      "summary": "With Web Pages it is easy to create a web site with a consistent layout.\nA Consistent Look\nOn the Internet you will discover many web sites with a consistent look and feel:\nEvery page have the same header\nEvery page have the same footer\nEvery page have the same style and layout\nWith Web Pages this can be done very efficiently. You can have reusable blocks of content (content blocks), like headers and footers, in separate files.\nYou can also define a consistent layout for all your pages, using a layout template (layout file).\nContent Blocks\nMany websites have content that is displayed on every page (like headers and footers).\nWith Web Pages you can use the @RenderPage() method to import content from separate files.\nContent block (from another file) can be imported anywhere in a web page, and can contain text, markup, and code, just like any regular web page.\nUsing common headers and footers as an example, this saves you a lot of work. You don't have to write the same content in every page, and when you change the header or footer files, the content is updated in all your pages.\nThis is how it looks in code:\nExample\nREMOVE ADS\nUsing a Layout Page\nIn the previous section, you saw that including the same content in many web pages is easy.\nAnother approach to creating a consistent look is to use a layout page. A layout page contains the structure, but not the content, of a web page. When a web page (content page) is linked to a layout page, it will be displayed according to the layout page (template).\nThe layout page is just like a normal web page, except from a call to the @RenderBody() method where the content page will be included.\nEach content page must start with a Layout directive.\nThis is how it looks in code:\nLayout Page:\nAny Web Page:\nD.R.Y. - Don't Repeat Yourself\nWith two ASP.NET tools, Content Blocks and Layout Pages, you can give your web applications a consistent look.\nThese tools also save you a lot of work, since you don't have to repeat the same information on all pages. Centralizing markup, style, and code makes web applications much more manageable and easier to maintain.\nPreventing Files from Being Browsed\nWith ASP.NET, files with a name that starts with an underscore cannot be browsed from the web.\nIf you want to prevent your content blocks or layout files from being viewed by your users, rename the files to:\n_header.cshtml\n_footer.cshtml\n_Layout.cshtml\nHiding Sensitive Information\nWith ASP.NET, the common way to hide sensitive information (database passwords, email passwords, etc.) is to keep the information in a separate file named \"_AppStart\".\n_AppStart.cshtml",

If you use virtual paths, you can move your pages to a different domain (or server) without having to update the paths.\nThe root on a disk drive is written like C:\\, but the root on a web site is  / (forward slash).\nThe virtual path of a web folder is (almost) never the same as the physical folder.\nIn your code you will, reference both the physical path and the virtual path, depending on what you are coding.\nASP.NET has 3 tools for working with folder paths: the ~ operator, the Server.MapPath method, and the Href method.\nThe ~ Operator\nTo specify the virtual root in programming code, use the ~ operator.\nIf you use the ~ operator, instead of a path, you can move your website to a different folder or location without changing any code:\nThe Server.MapPath Method\nThe Server.MapPath method converts a virtual path (/default.cshtml) to a physical path that the server can understand (C:\\Johnny\\MyWebSited\\Demo\\default.cshtml).\nYou will use this method when you need to open data files located on the server (data files can only be accessed with a full physical path):\nYou will learn more about reading from (and writing to) data files on the server in the next chapter of this tutorial.\nThe Href Method\nThe Href method converts a path used in the code to a path that the browser can understand (the browser cannot understand the ~ operator).\nYou use the Href method to create paths to resources like image files, and CSS files.\nYou will often use this method in HTML <a>, <img>, and <link> elements:\nThe Href method is a method of the WebPage Object.",

For example, if a web page contains an input form, the web page typically contains server code for reading the data.\nHowever, by creating a page named _AppStart in the root of your site, you can have startup code executed before the site starts. If this page exists, ASP.NET runs it the first time any page in the site is requested.\nTypical use for _AppStart is startup code and initialization of global values like counters and global names.\nNote 1: _AppStart should have the same file extension as your web pages, like: _AppStart.cshtml.\nNote 2: _AppStart has an underscore prefix. Because of this, the files cannot be browsed directly.\nBefore Every Page: _PageStart\nJust like _AppStart runs before your site starts, you can write code that runs before any page in each folder.\nFor each folder in your web, you can add a file named _PageStart.\nTypical use for _PageStart is setting the layout page for all pages in a folder, or checking that a user is logged in before running a page.\nHow Does it Work?\nThe following diagram shows how it works:\nWhen a request comes in, ASP.NET checks whether _AppStart exists. If so, and this is the first request to the site, _AppStart runs.\nThen ASP.NET checks whether _PageStart exists. If so, _PageStart runs, before the requested page.\nIf you include a call to RunPage() inside _PageStart you specify where you want the requested page to run.

It lets the user select a friendly name (like Photo 1), and passes a file name (like Photo1.jpg) when the page is submitted to the web server.\nThe Razor code reads the value of Choice by Request[\"Choice\"]. If it has a value the code constructs a path to the image images/Photo1.jpg, and stores it in the variable imagePath.\nIn the HTML page there is an <img> element to display the image.

SMTP is the \"output\" part of email. If you use a web host, you probably already know the name of the SMTP server. If you work in a corporate network, your IT department can give you the name. If you are working at home, you might be able to use your ordinary email provider.\nIn order to send an email you will need:\nThe name of the SMTP server\nThe port number (most often 25)\nAn email user name\nAn email password\nIn the root of your web, create a page (or edit the page ) named _AppStart.cshtml.\nPut the following code inside the file:\n_AppStart.cshtml\nThe code above will run each time the web site (application) starts. It feeds your WebMail Object with initial values.\nPlease substitute:\nsmtp.example.com with the name the SMTP server that will be used to send the emails.\n25 with the port number the server will use to send SMTP transactions (emails).\nfalse with true, if the server should use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption.\nsupport@example.com with the name of the SMTP email account used to send emails.\npassword with the password of the SMTP email account.\njohn@example with the email to appear in the from address.\nYou don't have to initiate the WebMail object in your AppStart file, but you must set these properties before you call the WebMail.Send() method.",

It's a server side markup language.\nWhat is Razor?\nRazor is a markup syntax that lets you embed server-based code (Visual Basic and C#) into web pages.\nServer-based code can create dynamic web content on the fly, while a web page is written to the browser. When a web page is called, the server executes the server-based code inside the page before it returns the page to the browser. By running on the server, the code can perform complex tasks, like accessing databases.\nRazor is based on ASP.NET, and designed for creating web applications. It has the power of traditional ASP.NET markup, but it is easier to use, and easier to learn.\nRazor Syntax\nRazor uses a syntax very similar to PHP and Classic ASP.\nRazor:\nPHP:\nClassic ASP:\nRazor Helpers\nASP.NET helpers are components that can be accessed by single lines of Razor code.\nYou can build your own helpers using Razor syntax, or use built-in ASP.NET helpers.\nBelow is a short description of some useful Razor helpers:\nWeb Grid\nWeb Graphics\nGoogle Analytics\nFacebook Integration\nTwitter Integration\nSending Email\nValidation\nRazor Programming Languages\nRazor supports both C# (C sharp) and VB (Visual Basic).",

The code that is executed on the server can perform tasks that cannot be done in the browser, for example accessing a server database. Server code can create dynamic HTML content on the fly, before it is sent to the browser. Seen from the browser, the HTML generated by server code is no different than static HTML content.\nASP.NET web pages with Razor syntax have the special file extension cshtml (Razor using C#) or vbhtml (Razor using VB).\nWorking With Objects\nServer coding often involves objects.\n\nThe \"DateTime\" object is a typical built-in ASP.NET object, but objects can also be self-defined, a web page, a text box, a file, a database record, etc.\n\nObjects may have methods they can perform. A database record might have a \"Save\" method, an image object might have a \"Rotate\" method, an email object might have a \"Send\" method, and so on.\n\nObjects also have properties that describe their characteristics. A database record might have a FirstName and a LastName property (among others).\nThe ASP.NET DateTime object has a Now property (written as DateTime.Now), and the Now property has a Day property (written as DateTime.Now.Day). The example below shows how to access some properties of the DateTime object:\nExample\nIf and Else Conditions\nAn important feature of dynamic web pages is that you can determine what to do based on conditions.\nThe common way to do this is with the if ... else statements:\nExample\nReading User Input\nAnother important feature of dynamic web pages is that you can read user input.\nInput is read by the Request[] function, and posting (input) is tested by the IsPost condition:\nExample",

Like this:\nNow you have created two variables. The name of the variables are \"x\" and \"carname\".\nYou can also declare variables by using its name in a script. Like this:\nNow you have also created a variable. The name of the variable is \"carname\". However, this method is not a good practice, because you can misspell the variable name later in your script, and that can cause strange results when your script is running.\nIf you misspell for example the \"carname\" variable to \"carnime\", the script will automatically create a new variable called \"carnime\".  To prevent your script from doing this, you can use the Option Explicit statement. This statement forces you to declare all your variables with the dim, public or private statement.\nPut the Option Explicit statement on the top of your script. Like this:\nAssigning Values to Variables\nYou assign a value to a variable like this:\nThe variable name is on the left side of the expression and the value you want to assign to the variable is on the right. Now the variable \"carname\" has the value of \"Volvo\", and the variable \"x\" has the value of \"10\".\nVBScript Array Variables\nAn array variable is used to store multiple values in a single variable.\nIn the following example, an array containing 3 elements is declared:\nThe number shown in the parentheses is 2. We start at zero so this array contains 3 elements. This is a fixed-size array. You assign data to each of the elements of the array like this:\nSimilarly, the data can be retrieved from any element using the index of the particular array element you want. Like this:\nYou can have up to 60 dimensions in an array. Multiple dimensions are declared by separating the numbers in the parentheses with commas. Here we have a two-dimensional array consisting of 5 rows and 7 columns:\nAssign data to a two-dimensional array:\nExample\nThe Lifetime of Variables\nA variable declared outside a procedure can be accessed and changed by any script in the ASP file.\nA variable declared inside a procedure is created and destroyed every time the procedure is executed. No scripts outside the procedure can access or change the variable.\nTo declare variables accessible to more than one ASP file, declare them as session variables or application variables.\nSession Variables\nSession variables are used to store information about ONE single user, and are available to all pages in one application. Typically information stored in session variables are name, id, and preferences.\nApplication Variables\nApplication variables are also available to all pages in one application. Application variables are used to store information about ALL users in one specific application.",

This is much like a Session. The computer knows who you are. It knows when you open the application and when you close it. However, on the internet there is one problem: the web server does not know who you are and what you do, because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.\nASP solves this problem by creating a unique cookie for each user. The cookie is sent to the user's computer and it contains information that identifies the user. This interface is called the Session object.\nThe Session object stores information about, or change settings for a user session.\nVariables stored in a Session object hold information about one single user, and are available to all pages in one application. Common information stored in session variables are name, id, and preferences. The server creates a new Session object for each new user, and destroys the Session object when the session expires.\nWhen does a Session Start?\nA session starts when:\nA new user requests an ASP file, and the Global.asa file includes a Session_OnStart procedure\nA value is stored in a Session variable\nA user requests an ASP file, and the Global.asa file uses the <object> tag to instantiate an object with session scope\nWhen does a Session End?\nA session ends if a user has not requested or refreshed a page in the application for a specified period. By default, this is 20 minutes.\nIf you want to set a timeout interval that is shorter or longer than the default, use the Timeout property.\nThe example below sets a timeout interval of 5 minutes:\nUse the Abandon method to end a session immediately:\nNote: The main problem with sessions is WHEN they should end. We do not know if the user's last request was the final one or not. So we do not know how long we should keep the session \"alive\". Waiting too long for an idle session uses up resources on the server, but if the session is deleted too soon the user has to start all over again because the server has deleted all the information. Finding the right timeout interval can be difficult!\nTip: Only store SMALL amounts of data in session variables!\nREMOVE ADS\nStore and Retrieve Session Variables\nThe most important thing about the Session object is that you can store variables in it.\nThe example below will set the Session variable username to \"Donald Duck\" and the Session variable age to \"50\":\nWhen the value is stored in a session variable it can be reached from ANY page in the ASP application:\nThe line above returns: \"Welcome Donald Duck\".\nYou can also store user preferences in the Session object, and then access that preference to choose what page to return to the user.\nThe example below specifies a text-only version of the page if the user has a low screen resolution:\nRemove Session Variables\nThe Contents collection contains all session variables.\nIt is possible to remove a session variable with the Remove method.\nThe example below removes the session variable \"sale\" if the value of the session variable \"age\" is lower than 18:\nTo remove all variables in a session, use the RemoveAll method:\nLoop Through the Contents Collection\nThe Contents collection contains all session variables. You can loop through the Contents collection, to see what's stored in it:\nResult:\nIf you do not know the number of items in the Contents collection, you can use the Count property:\nResult:\nLoop Through the StaticObjects Collection\nYou can loop through the StaticObjects collection, to see the values of all objects stored in the Session object:",

The Application object is used to tie these files together.\nThe Application object is used to store and access variables from any page, just like the Session object. The difference is that ALL users share ONE Application object (with Sessions there is ONE Session object for EACH user).\nThe Application object holds information that will be used by many pages in the application (like database connection information). The information can be accessed from any page. The information can also be changed in one place, and the changes will automatically be reflected on all pages.\nStore and Retrieve Application Variables\nApplication variables can be accessed and changed by any page in an application.\nYou can create Application variables in \"Global.asa\" like this:\nIn the example above we have created two Application variables: \"vartime\" and \"users\".\nYou can access the value of an Application variable like this:\nREMOVE ADS\nLoop Through the Contents Collection\nThe Contents collection contains all application variables.

A relative path begins with the directory that contains the including file.\nIf you have a file in the html directory, and the file \"header.inc\" resides in html\\headers, the following line would insert \"header.inc\" in your file:\nNote that the path to the included file (headers\\header.inc) is relative to the including file. If the file containing this #include statement is not in the html directory, the statement will not work.\nTips and Notes\nIn the sections above we have used the file extension \".inc\" for included files. Notice that if a user tries to browse an INC file directly, its content will be displayed. If your included file contains confidential information or information you do not want any users to see, it is better to use an ASP extension. The source code in an ASP file will not be visible after the interpretation. An included file can also include other files, and one ASP file can include the same file more than once.\nImportant: Included files are processed and inserted before the scripts are executed. The following script will NOT work because ASP executes the #include directive before it assigns a value to the variable:\nYou cannot open or close a script delimiter in an INC file.

      "summary": "The Global.asa file\nThe Global.asa file is an optional file that can contain declarations of objects, variables, and methods that can be accessed by every page in an ASP application.\nAll valid browser scripts (JavaScript, VBScript, JScript, PerlScript, etc.) can be used within Global.asa.\nThe Global.asa file can contain only the following:\nApplication events\nSession events\n<object> declarations\nTypeLibrary declarations\nthe #include directive\nNote: The Global.asa file must be stored in the root directory of the ASP application, and each application can only have one Global.asa file.\nEvents in Global.asa\nIn Global.asa you can tell the application and session objects what to do when the application/session starts and what to do when the application/session ends. The code for this is placed in event handlers. The Global.asa file can contain four types of events:\nSession_OnStart - This event occurs EVERY time a NEW user requests his or her first page in the ASP application.\nSession_OnEnd - This event occurs EVERY time a user ends a session. A user-session ends after a page has not been requested by the user for a specified time (by default this is 20 minutes).\nApplication_OnEnd - This event occurs after the LAST user has ended the session. Typically, this event occurs when a Web server stops. This procedure is used to clean up settings after the Application stops, like delete records or write information to text files.\nA Global.asa file could look something like this:\nNote: Because we cannot use the ASP script delimiters (<% and %>) to insert scripts in the Global.asa file, we put subroutines inside an HTML <script> element.\nREMOVE ADS\n<object> Declarations\nIt is possible to create objects with session or application scope in Global.asa by using the <object> tag.\nNote: The <object> tag should be outside the <script> tag!\nSyntax\nEither ProgID or ClassID must be specified.\nEither ProgID or ClassID must be specified.\nExamples\nThe first example creates an object of session scope named \"MyAd\" by using the ProgID parameter:\nThe second example creates an object of application scope named \"MyConnection\" by using the ClassID parameter:\nThe objects declared in the Global.asa file can be used by any script in the application:\nTypeLibrary Declarations\nA TypeLibrary is a container for the contents of a DLL file corresponding to a COM object. By including a call to the TypeLibrary in the Global.asa file, the constants of the COM object can be accessed, and errors can be better reported by the ASP code. If your Web application relies on COM objects that have declared data types in type libraries, you can declare the type libraries in Global.asa.\nSyntax\nEither the file parameter or the uuid parameter is required\nEither the file parameter or the uuid parameter is required\nError Values\nThe server can return one of the following error messages:\nNote: METADATA tags can appear anywhere in the Global.asa file (both inside and outside <script> tags). However, it is recommended that METADATA tags appear near the top of the Global.asa file.\nRestrictions\nRestrictions on what you can include in the Global.asa file:\nYou cannot display text written in the Global.asa file. This file can't display information\nYou can only use Server and Application objects in the Application_OnStart and Application_OnEnd subroutines. In the Session_OnEnd subroutine, you can use Server, Application, and Session objects. In the Session_OnStart subroutine you can use any built-in object\nHow to use the Subroutines\nGlobal.asa is often used to initialize variables.\nThe example below shows how to detect the exact time a visitor first arrives on a Web site. The time is stored in a Session variable named \"started\", and the value of the \"started\" variable can be accessed from any ASP page in the application:\nGlobal.asa can also be used to control page access.\nThe example below shows how to redirect every new visitor to another page, in this case to a page called \"newpage.asp\":\nAnd you can include functions in the Global.asa file.\nIn the example below the Application_OnStart subroutine occurs when the Web server starts. Then the Application_OnStart subroutine calls another subroutine named \"getcustomers\". The \"getcustomers\" subroutine opens a database and retrieves a record set from the \"customers\" table. The record set is assigned to an array, where it can be accessed from any ASP page without querying the database:\nGlobal.asa Example\nIn this example we will create a Global.asa file that counts the number of current visitors.\nThe Application_OnStart sets the Application variable \"visitors\" to 0 when the server starts\nThe Session_OnStart subroutine adds one to the variable \"visitors\" every time a new visitor arrives\nThe Session_OnEnd subroutine subtracts one from \"visitors\" each time this subroutine is triggered\nThe Global.asa file:\nTo display the number of current visitors in an ASP file:",

This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.\nClassic web pages, (which do not use AJAX) must reload the entire page if the content should change.\nExamples of applications using AJAX: Google Maps, Gmail, Youtube, and Facebook tabs.\nHow AJAX Works\nAJAX is Based on Internet Standards\nAJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:\nXMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server)\nJavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information)\nCSS (to style the data)\nXML (often used as the format for transferring data)\nAJAX applications are browser- and platform-independent!\nREMOVE ADS\nGoogle Suggest\nAJAX was made popular in 2005 by Google, with Google Suggest.\nGoogle Suggest is using AJAX to create a very dynamic web interface: When you start typing in Google's search box, a JavaScript sends the letters off to a server and the server returns a list of suggestions.\nStart Using AJAX Today\nIn our ASP tutorial, we will demonstrate how AJAX can update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page. The server script will be written in ASP.\nIf you want to learn more about AJAX, visit our AJAX tutorial.\nAJAX ASP Example\nThe following example will demonstrate how a web page can communicate with a web server while a user type characters in an input field:\nExample\nStart typing a name in the input field below:\nSuggestions:\nExample Explained\nIn the example above, when a user types a character in the input field, a function called \"showHint()\" is executed.\nThe function is triggered by the onkeyup event.\nHere is the HTML code:\nExample\nCode explanation:\nFirst, check if the input field is empty (str.length == 0). If it is, clear the content of the txtHint placeholder and exit the function.\nHowever, if the input field is not empty, do the following:\nCreate an XMLHttpRequest object\nCreate the function to be executed when the server response is ready\nSend the request off to an ASP file (gethint.asp) on the server\nNotice that q parameter is added gethint.asp?q=\"+str\nThe str variable holds the content of the input field\nThe ASP File - \"gethint.asp\"\nThe ASP file checks an array of names, and returns the corresponding name(s) to the browser:\nAJAX can be used for interactive communication with a database.\nAJAX Database Example\nThe following example will demonstrate how a web page can fetch information from a database with AJAX:\nExample\nTry it Yourself »\nExample Explained - The HTML Page\nWhen a user selects a customer in the dropdown list above, a function called \"showCustomer()\" is executed.

      "title": "ASP Quick Reference",
      "summary": "ASP Quick Reference from W3Schools. Print it, and fold it in your pocket.\nBasic Syntax\nASP scripts are surrounded by <% and %>.  To write some output to a browser:\n<html>\n<body>\n<% response.write(\"Hello World!\") %>\n</body>\n</html>\nThe default language in ASP is VBScript. To use another scripting language, insert a language specification at the top of the ASP page:\n<%@ language=\"javascript\" %>\n<html>\n<body>\n<%\n....\n%>\nForms and User Input\nRequest.QueryString is used to collect values in a form with method=\"get\". Information sent from a form with the GET method is visible to everyone (it will be displayed in the browser's address bar) and has limits on the amount of information to send.\nRequest.Form is used to collect values in a form with method=\"post\". Information sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others and has no limits on the amount of information to send.\nASP Cookies\nA cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests for a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too.\nThe Response.Cookies command is used to create cookies:\n<%\nResponse.Cookies(\"firstname\")=\"Alex\"\nResponse.Cookies(\"firstname\").Expires=\"May 10,2002\"\n%>\nNote: The Response.Cookies command must appear BEFORE the <html> tag!\nThe \"Request.Cookies\" command is used to retrieve a cookie value:\n<%\nfname=Request.Cookies(\"firstname\")\nresponse.write(\"Firstname=\" & fname)\n%>\nREMOVE ADS\nIncluding Files\nYou can insert the content of one ASP file into another ASP file before the server executes it, with the #include directive. The #include directive is used to create functions, headers, footers, or elements that will be reused on multiple pages\nSyntax:\n<!--#include virtual=\"somefile.inc\"-->\nor\n<!--#include file =\"somefile.inc\"-->\nUse the virtual keyword to indicate a path beginning with a virtual directory. If a file named \"header.inc\" resides in a virtual directory named /html, the following line would insert the contents of \"header.inc\":\n<!-- #include virtual =\"/html/header.inc\" -->\nUse the file keyword to indicate a relative path. A relative path begins with the directory that contains the including file. If you have a file in the html directory, and the file \"header.inc\" resides in html\\headers, the following line would insert \"header.inc\" in your file:\n<!-- #include file =\"headers\\header.inc\" -->\nUse the file keyword with the syntax (..\\) to include a file from a higher-level directory.\nGlobal.asa\nThe Global.asa file is an optional file that can contain declarations of objects, variables, and methods that can be accessed by every page in an ASP application.\nNote: The Global.asa file must be stored in the root directory of the ASP application, and each application can only have one Global.asa file.\nThe Global.asa file can contain only the following:\nApplication events\nSession events\n<object> declarations\nTypeLibrary declarations\nthe #include directive\nApplication and Session Events\nIn Global.asa you can tell the application and session objects what to do when the application/session starts and what to do when the application/session ends. The code for this is placed in event handlers. Note: We do not use <% and %>, to insert scripts in the Global.asa file, we have to put the subroutines inside the HTML <script> tag:\n<script language=\"vbscript\" runat=\"server\">\nsub Application_OnStart\n' some code\nend sub\nsub Application_OnEnd\n' some code\nend sub\nsub Session_OnStart\n' some code\nend sub\nsub Session_OnEnd\n' some code\nend sub\n</script>\n<object> Declarations\nIt is also possible to create objects with session or application scope in Global.asa by using the <object> tag. Note: The <object> tag should be outside the <script> tag!\nSyntax:\n<object runat=\"server\" scope=\"scope\" id=\"id\"\n{progid=\"progID\"|classid=\"classID\"}>\n.......\n</object>\nTypeLibrary Declarations\nA TypeLibrary is a container for the contents of a DLL file corresponding to a COM object. By including a call to the TypeLibrary in the Global.asa file, the constants of the COM object can be accessed, and errors can be better reported by the ASP code. If your Web application relies on COM objects that have declared data types in type libraries, you can declare the type libraries in Global.asa.\nSyntax:\n<!--METADATA TYPE=\"TypeLib\"\nfile=\"filename\"\nuuid=\"typelibraryuuid\"\nversion=\"versionnumber\"\nlcid=\"localeid\"\n-->\nThe Session Object\nThe Session object is used to store information about, or change settings for a user session. Variables stored in the Session object hold information about one single user, and are available to all pages in one application.\nCollections\nContents - Holds every item added to the session with script commands\nStaticObjects - Holds every object added to the session with the <object> tag, and a given session\nContents.Remove(item/index) - Deletes an item from the Contents collection\nContents.RemoveAll() - Deletes every item from the Contents collection\nProperties\nCodePage - Sets the code page that will be used to display dynamic content\nLCID - Sets the locale identifier that will be used to display dynamic content\nSessionID - Returns the session id\nTimeout - Sets the timeout for the session\nMethod\nAbandon - Kills every object in a session object\nApplication Object\nA group of ASP files that work together to perform some purpose is called an application. The Application object in ASP is used to tie these files together. All users share one Application object. The Application object should hold information that will be used by many pages in the application (like database connection information).\nCollections\nContents - Holds every item added to the application with script commands\nStaticObjects - Holds every object added to the application with the <object> tag\nContents.Remove - Deletes an item from a collection\nContents.RemoveAll - Deletes every item from a collection\nMethods\nLock - Prevents a user from changing the application object properties\nUnlock - Allows a user to change the application object properties\nThe Response Object\nThe Response Object is used to send output to the user from the server.\nCollection\nCookies(name) - Sets a cookie value. If the cookie does not exist, it will be created, and take the value that is specified\nProperties\nBuffer - Whether to buffer the output or not. When the output is buffered, the server will hold back the response until all of the server scripts have been processed, or until the script calls the Flush or End method. If this property is set, it should be before the <html> tag in the ASP file\nCacheControl - Sets whether proxy servers can cache the output or not. When set to Public, the output can be cached by a proxy server\nCharset(charset_name) - Sets the name of the character set (like \"ISO8859-1\") to the content type header\nContentType - Sets the HTTP content type (like \"text/html\", \"image/gif\", \"image/jpeg\", \"text/plain\"). Default is \"text/html\"\nExpires - Sets how long a page will be cached on a browser before it expires\nExpiresAbsolute - Sets a date and time when a page cached on a browser will expire\nIsClientConnected - Checks if the client is still connected to the server\nPics(pics_label) - Adds a value to the pics label response header\nStatus - Specifies the value of the status line\nMethods\nAddHeader(name, value) - Adds an HTML header with a specified value\nAppendToLog string - Adds a string to the end of the server log entry\nBinaryWrite(data_to_write) - Writes the given information without any character-set conversion\nClear - Clears the buffered output. Use this method to handle errors. If Response.Buffer is not set to true, this method will cause a run-time error\nEnd - Stops processing the script, and return the current result\nFlush - Sends buffered output immediately. If Response.Buffer is not set to true, this method will cause a run-time error\nRedirect(url) - Redirects the user to another url\nWrite(data_to_write) - Writes a text to the user\nRequest Object\nWhen a browser asks for a page from a server, it is called a request. The Request Object is used to get information from the user.\nCollection\nClientCertificate - Holds field values stored in the client certificate\nCookies(name) - Holds cookie values\nForm(element_name) - Holds form (input) values. The form must use the post method\nQueryString(variable_name) - Holds variable values in the query string\nServerVariables(server_variable) - Holds server variable values\nProperty\nTotalBytes - Holds the total number of bytes the client is sending in the body of the request\nMethod\nBinaryRead - Fetches the data that is sent to the server from the client as part of a post request\nServer Object\nThe Server Object is used to access properties and methods on the server.\nProperty\nScriptTimeout - Sets how long a script can run before it is terminated\nMethod\nCreateObject(type_of_object) - Creates an instance of an object\nExecute(path) - Executes an ASP file from inside another ASP file. After executing the called ASP file, the control is returned to the original ASP file\nGetLastError() - Returns an ASPError object that will describe the error that occurred\nHTMLEncode(string) - Applies HTML encoding to a string\nMapPath(path) - Maps a relative or virtual path to a physical path\nTransfer(path) - Sends all of the state information to another ASP file for processing. After the transfer, procedural control is not returned to the original ASP file\nURLEncode(string) - Applies URL encoding rules to a string\nSource : https://www.w3schools.com/asp/asp_quickref.asp",
