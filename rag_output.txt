title: Introduction to XML
summary: XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data.
What is XML?
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language
XML is a markup language much like HTML
XML was designed to store and transport data
XML was designed to be self-descriptive
XML is a W3C Recommendation
XML Does Not DO Anything
Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything.
This note is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:
The XML above is quite self-descriptive:
It has sender information
It has receiver information
It has a heading
It has a message body
But still, the XML above does not DO anything. XML is just information wrapped in tags.
Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive, store, or display it:

The Difference Between XML and HTML
XML and HTML were designed with different goals:
XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are
REMOVE ADS
XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags
The XML language has no predefined tags.
The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.
HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.
With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.
XML is Extensible

title: XML Tree
summary: XML documents form a tree structure that starts at "the root" and branches to "the leaves".
The XML Tree Structure
An Example XML Document
The image above represents books in this XML:

XML Tree Structure
XML documents are formed as element trees.
An XML tree starts at a root element and branches from the root to child elements.
All elements can have sub elements (child elements):
The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships between elements.
Parents have children. Children have parents. Siblings are children on the same level (brothers and sisters).
All elements can have text content (Harry Potter) and attributes (category="cooking").
Self-Describing Syntax
XML uses a much self-describing syntax.
A prolog defines the XML version and the character encoding:
The next line is the root element of the document:
The next line starts a <book> element:
The <book> elements have 4 child elements: <title>, <author>, <year>, <price>.
The next line ends the book element:
You can assume, from this example, that the XML document contains information about books in a bookstore.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<bookstore>
<book category="cooking">
<title lang="en">Everyday Italian</title>
<author>Giada De Laurentiis</author>
<year>2005</year>
<price>30.00</price>
</book>
<book category="children">
<title lang="en">Harry Potter</title>
<author>J K. Rowling</author>
<year>2005</year>

title: XML Elements
summary: An XML document contains XML Elements.
What is an XML Element?
An XML element is everything from (including) the element's start tag to (including) the element's end tag.
An element can contain:
text
attributes
other elements
or a mix of the above
In the example above:
<title>, <author>, <year>, and <price> have text content because they contain text (like 29.99).
<bookstore> and <book> have element contents, because they contain elements.
<book> has an attribute (category="children").
Empty XML Elements
An element with no content is said to be empty.
In XML, you can indicate an empty element like this:
You can also use a so called self-closing tag:
The two forms produce identical results in XML software (Readers, Parsers, Browsers).
Empty elements can have attributes.
REMOVE ADS
XML Naming Rules
XML elements must follow these naming rules:
Element names are case-sensitive
Element names must start with a letter or underscore
Element names cannot start with the letters xml (or XML, or Xml, etc)
Element names can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods
Element names cannot contain spaces
Any name can be used, no words are reserved (except xml).
Best Naming Practices
Create descriptive names, like this: <person>, <firstname>, <lastname>.
Create short and simple names, like this: <book_title> not like this: <the_title_of_the_book>.
Avoid "-". If you name something "first-name", some software may think you want to subtract "name" from "first".

title: How Can XML be Used?
summary: XML is used in many aspects of web development.
XML is often used to separate data from presentation.
XML Separates Data from Presentation
XML does not carry any information about how to be displayed.
The same XML data can be used in many different presentation scenarios.
Because of this, with XML, there is a full separation between data and presentation.
XML is Often a Complement to HTML
In many HTML applications, XML is used to store or transport data, while HTML is used to format and display the same data.
XML Separates Data from HTML
When displaying data in HTML, you should not have to edit the HTML file when the data changes.
With XML, the data can be stored in separate XML files.
With a few lines of JavaScript code, you can read an XML file and update the data content of any HTML page.
Books.xml
You will learn a lot more about using XML and JavaScript in the DOM section of this tutorial.

Transaction Data
Thousands of XML formats exist, in many different industries, to describe day-to-day data transactions:
Stocks and Shares
Financial transactions
Medical data
Mathematical data
Scientific measurements
News information
Weather services
Example: XML News
XMLNews is a specification for exchanging news and other information.
Using a standard makes it easier for both news producers and news consumers to produce, receive, and archive any kind of news information across different hardware, software, and programming languages.
An example XMLNews document:
Example: XML Weather Service
An XML national weather service from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<bookstore>

title: PHP XML Parsers
summary: What is XML?
The XML language is a way to structure data for sharing across websites.
Several web technologies like RSS Feeds and Podcasts are written in XML.
XML is easy to create. It looks a lot like HTML, except that you make up your own tags.
If you want to learn more about XML, please visit our XML tutorial.
What is an XML Parser?
To read and update, create and manipulate an XML document, you will need an XML parser.
In PHP there are two major types of XML parsers:
Tree-Based Parsers
Event-Based Parsers
Tree-Based Parsers
Tree-based parsers holds the entire document in Memory and transforms the XML document into a Tree structure. It analyzes the whole document, and provides access to the Tree elements (DOM).
This type of parser is a better option for smaller XML documents, but not for large XML document as it causes major performance issues.
Example of tree-based parsers:
SimpleXML
DOM
Event-Based Parsers
Event-based parsers do not hold the entire document in Memory, instead, they read in one node at a time and allow you to interact with in real time. Once you move onto the next node, the old one is thrown away.
This type of parser is well suited for large XML documents. It parses faster and consumes less memory.
Example of event-based parsers:
XMLReader
XML Expat Parser

XML Elements Must be Properly Nested
In HTML, you might see improperly nested elements:
In XML, all elements must be properly nested within each other:
In the example above, "Properly nested" simply means that since the <i> element is opened inside the <b> element, it must be closed inside the <b> element.
XML Attribute Values Must Always be Quoted
XML elements can have attributes in name/value pairs just like in HTML.
In XML, the attribute values must always be quoted:
Entity References
Some characters have a special meaning in XML.
If you place a character like "<" inside an XML element, it will generate an error because the parser interprets it as the start of a new element.
This will generate an XML error:
To avoid this error, replace the "<" character with an entity reference:
There are 5 pre-defined entity references in XML:
Only < and & are strictly illegal in XML, but it is a good habit to replace > with &gt; as well.
Comments in XML
The syntax for writing comments in XML is similar to that of HTML:
Two dashes in the middle of a comment are not allowed:
White-space is Preserved in XML
XML does not truncate multiple white-spaces (HTML truncates multiple white-spaces to one single white-space):
XML Stores New Line as LF
Windows applications store a new line as: carriage return and line feed (CR+LF).
Unix and Mac OSX use LF.
Old Mac systems use CR.
XML stores a new line as LF.
Well Formed XML
XML documents that conform to the syntax rules above are said to be "Well Formed" XML documents.

-------- INSTRUCTIONS / PROMPT --------
You are a professional **Coding Tutorial Chatbot** embedded in a **Streamlit app**.  
                Your purpose is to help learners understand programming concepts, complete exercises,  
                and build confidence in coding—strictly using the provided **context documents (vectorstore)**.  

                ---

                ✅ Core Guidelines:
                1. **Source Discipline**  
                - Use only the given context to generate responses.  
                - Do not invent, assume, or use external knowledge.  

                2. **Response Rules**  
                - If a user asks about an unsupported topic, reply with exactly:  
                    ❌ Sorry, this topic is not supported yet. Please wait for an update.  
                - If context lacks enough information, reply with exactly:  
                    I don’t have enough information in my training material to answer that.  

                3. **Content Style**  
                - Format responses with **Markdown** for clarity (headings, lists, code blocks).  
                - Structure tutorials into **sections** (e.g., *Introduction → Examples → Practice*).  
                - Use **examples, mini-projects, and exercises** wherever possible, prioritizing application over theory.  
                - Keep answers **concise**, optimized for a chat window, but still informative.  

                ---

                🤝 Tone & Interaction Style:
                - Be **friendly, approachable, and professional**—like a patient coding mentor.  
                - Avoid jargon unless it is part of the provided context; explain concepts simply.  
                - Encourage learning with supportive language (e.g., “Great job! Now try…”).  

                ---

                🚫 Pitfalls to Avoid:
                - Never provide content outside of the context.  
                - Never modify or rephrase the unsupported/insufficient-info messages.  
                - Avoid overly long, lecture-style responses—break complex topics into **digestible steps**.  
                - Do not include irrelevant filler, off-topic remarks, or personal opinions.  

                ---

                🎯 Goal:  
                Deliver clear, accurate, and engaging coding tutorials strictly from the provided material,  
                ensuring users can learn through structured explanations, examples, and practice exercises.
