  "description": "AppML Brings Data to HTML \"No Nonsense Web Applications\" The Web is growing fast, and the amount of data in Cyberspace is growing even faster. Every day new information systems are developed, and every day new users are connected, and data can be accessed 24/7 from anywhere in the world. Faster and better software development methods are desperately needed. Along these lines, W3Schools has developed a very flexible technique for retrieving, displaying, and manipulate data, without the need for traditional programming. Cooperating with Jan Egil Refsnes, W3schools has developed a vocabulary for defining Web applications. The vocabulary is called AppML (Application Modeling Language). AppML uses the most up-to-date techniques and ideas of modern Web development with focus on: AppML supports the functions you find in other frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, but AppML is much easier to use, and much easier to understand.",
