  "description": "Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial intelligence \"Learning machines to imitate human intelligence\" Traditional programming uses algorithms to produce results from data: Data + Algorithms = Results Machine learning creates algorithms from data and results: Data + Results = Algorithms Neural Networks is: Neural Networks are based on how the human brain works:\nNeurons are sending messages to each other. While the neurons are trying to solve a problem (over and over again), it is strengthening the connections that lead to success and diminishing the connections that lead to failure. The Perceptron defines the first step into Neural Networks. It represents a single neuron with only one input layer, and no hidden layers. Learn how to program a perceptron. Neural Networks are Multi-Layer Perceptrons. In its simplest form, a neural network is made up from: In the Neural Network Model, input data (yellow) are processed against a hidden layer (blue) before producing the final output (re",
