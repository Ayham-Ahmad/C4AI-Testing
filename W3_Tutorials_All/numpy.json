  "description": "NumPy is a Python library. NumPy is used for working with arrays. NumPy is short for \"Numerical Python\". We have created 43 tutorial pages for you to learn more about NumPy. Starting with a basic introduction and ends up with creating and plotting random data sets, and working with NumPy functions: REMOVE ADS In our \"Try it Yourself\" editor, you can use the NumPy module, and modify the code to see the result. Create a NumPy array: Click on the \"Try it Yourself\" button to see how it works. Many chapters in this tutorial end with an exercise where you can check your level of knowledge.
