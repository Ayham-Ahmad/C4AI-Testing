In our example it will output \"Hello World!\". To end the code, you must remember a semicolon (;).\nWhat is a macro?\nA macro is like a function, but with an exclamation mark (!) after it. Don't worry about the terminology for now. For now, just know that macros are similar to functions (they execute things), but they do not always follow the same rules as functions. You will learn more about macros later.\nGood to know: The Rust compiler ignores white spaces.\nThe code above could also been written as:\nfn main(){println!(\"Hello World!\");}\nHowever, multiple lines and indentation makes the code more readable.",

It is an escape sequence, and it forces the cursor to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen.

Either way, it is good to understand what the different types mean.\nBasic data types in Rust are divided into different groups:\nNumbers - Whole numbers and decimal numbers (i32, f64)\nCharacters - Single letters or symbols (char)\nStrings - Text, a sequence of characters (&str)\nBooleans - True or false values (bool)\nNumbers\nNumber types are divided into two groups: integer types and floating point types.\nInteger (i32)\nThe i32 type is used to store whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals:\nExample\nFloating Point (f64)\nThe f64 type is used to store numbers containing one or more decimals:\nExample\nCharacters (char)\nThe char type is used to store a single character.

It skips 3 and stops before 5.\nRust Loops Summary\nRust has three types of loops that let you run code over and over again. Each one is used in different situations:\n1. loop\nThe simplest kind of loop. It runs forever unless you stop it with break.\nUse loop when you don't know in advance how many times to repeat.\n2. while\nRepeats code while a condition is true. It checks the condition before each loop.\nUse while when you want to repeat code until something happens.\n3. for\nRepeats code a fixed number of times.\nUse for when you know exactly what to loop through.\nExtra Keywords\nYou can use these in any loop:\nbreak - stop the loop\ncontinue - skip a value in the loop\nNow that you know how loops work, you are ready to start working with functions and reusable code!",

Trying to use it outside the function will cause an error.\nVariable Inside a Block\nYou can also create blocks inside other code, like in if statements or loops. Variables created in these blocks are only valid inside them.\nExample\nVariables in the Same Scope\nIn Rust, you can declare a new variable with the same name in the same scope using let. This is called shadowing:\nExample\nThe second x replaces the first one. The value 5 is no longer accessible after the second declaration.\nThis is different from languages that disallow reusing variable names. In Rust, it's a feature used to transform or update values safely.\nYou can also reuse a variable name inside a new block:\nExample\nHere, the two x variables are in different scopes. The inner x only exists inside the block. Outside the block, the original value remains.\nNote: Even though shadowing is allowed, using the same name too often can make your code harder to read.

Then we move it to b:\nExample\nWhen we assign a to b, the ownership moves. This means only b can use the value now, because a is no longer valid.\nBut simple types like numbers, characters and booleans are copied, not moved.\nThis means you can still use the original variable after assigning it to another:\nExample\nHere, a is copied into b, not moved, so you can still use b.\nClone\nFor other types, like String, if you really want to keep the original value and also assign it to another variable, you can use the .clone() method, which makes a copy of the data:\nExample\nHowever, if you don't need to own the value twice, using a reference (&) is usually better than cloning, which you will learn more about in the next chapter.\nWhy Ownership Matters\nRust uses ownership to automatically free memory when it's no longer needed\nIt prevents bugs like using memory that's already been deleted\nIt is one of the reasons Rust is so safe and fast\nNext: Learn about borrowing - how to let other parts of your program use a value without taking ownership.",
