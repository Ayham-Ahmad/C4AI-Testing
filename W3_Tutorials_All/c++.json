In the next steps, we will show you how to use an IDE that includes both.\nInstall C++ IDE\nAn IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.\nPopular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code.\nNote: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.\nWe will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.\nYou can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.\nC++ Quickstart\nLet's create our first C++ file.\nOpen Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.\nWrite the following C++ code and save the file as myfirstprogram.cpp (File > Save File as):\nDon't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later chapters.

      "summary": "C++ Syntax\nLet's break up the following code to understand it better:\nExample\nExample explained\nLine 1: #include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.\nLine 2: using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.\nDon't worry if you don't understand how #include <iostream> and using namespace std works. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.\nLine 3: A blank line. C++ ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.\nLine 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.\nLine 5: cout (pronounced \"see-out\") is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example, it will output \"Hello World!\".\nNote: C++ is case-sensitive: \"cout\" and \"Cout\" has different meaning.\nNote: Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;.\nNote: The body of int main() could also been written as:\nint main () { cout << \"Hello World! \"; return 0; }\nRemember: The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.\nLine 6: return 0; ends the main function.\nLine 7: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.\nOmitting Namespace\nYou might see some C++ programs that runs without the standard namespace library. The using namespace std line can be omitted and replaced with the std keyword, followed by the :: operator for some objects:\nExample\nIt is up to you if you want to include the standard namespace library or not.",

This is different from a regular while loop, which would skip the loop entirely if the condition is false at the start.\nThis behavior makes do/while useful when you want to ensure something happens at least once, like showing a message or asking for user input.\nPractical Example: User Input\nThis example keeps asking the user to enter a positive number.

This includes creating, using, and releasing memory when it's no longer needed.\nMemory in C++\nWhen you create a variable in C++, the compiler automatically reserves space in memory for it.\nFor example:\nThe line above tells the program: \"I need space to store an integer.\" C++ handles this memory automatically, so in this case, you dont have to worry about managing memory.\nGet Memory Size\nYou can check how much memory a variable type uses with the sizeof operator:\nExample\nKnowing the size of types helps you write more efficient code, especially in larger programs.\nDo You Have to Manage Memory Yourself?\nSometimes yes - and sometimes no.\nFor normal variables (like int x = 10;), C++ takes care of the memory for you.\nBut when you want to create memory manually while the program is running (for example: based on user input), you need to manage it yourself and clean it up when you're done.\nIf your program uses too much memory, or forgets to clean up memory it no longer needs, it can lead to slow performance or even crashes.\nThat's why understanding memory is important. It gives you more control and helps avoid common bugs.\nWhat's Next?\nIn C++, you can use pointers to access and change memory directly.\nThis is powerful, but also risky. If you use a pointer the wrong way, you could accidentally change or damage other parts of your program's memory.\nIn the next chapter, you'll learn how to create memory manually using pointers - with the new keyword, and how to free it using delete.",

For single variables, use new and delete.\nDynamic arrays are useful when you don't know the size of the array in advance - like when the size depends on user input or other values that are not known at the start of the program.\nFor example, imagine you run a hotel. Since you don't know how many guests will arrive, you ask the user for the number and create that many rooms - one to store each guest's name:\nExample\nExample Result:\nWhen to Use new\nIn most cases, you don't need to use new.

When k becomes 0, the function just returns 0. When running, the program follows these steps:\nSince the function does not call itself when k is 0, the program stops there and returns the result.\nThe developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power.\nHowever, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.\nCountdown\nThis example demonstrates how to use recursion to create a countdown function:\nExample\nThe function calls itself with n - 1 until n becomes 0.\nFactorial of a Number\nThis example uses a recursive function to calculate the factorial of 5:\nFactorial means multiplying a number by every number below it, down to 1 (for example, the factorial of 5 is: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120).",

If you change x after defining the lambda, it won't affect the value inside the lambda.\nNote: You can also use [&] to capture by reference.\nCapture by Reference\nIf you want the lambda to use the latest value of a variable (not just a copy), you can use [&] to capture it by reference.\nThis means the lambda will work with the original variable, not a separate copy:\nResult:\nWhy? The lambda sees the original x variable, so when you change x, the lambda uses the updated value.\nRegular Functions vs Lambda Functions\nBoth regular functions and lambda functions let you group code and run it later, but they are used in slightly different situations.\nYou plan to reuse the function in multiple places\nYou want to give the function a clear, meaningful name\nThe logic is long or complex\nYou only need the function once\nThe code is short and simple\nYou want to pass a quick function into another function\nBoth of these examples do the same thing.

We can use the ctime() function to show the date and time that a timestamp represents:\nExample\nDisplay the current date:\nTwo ways to use the time() function\nThe time() function writes a timestamp to the memory location given by the parameter, but it also returns the timestamp's value.\nAn alternative way to use the time() function is to pass in a NULL pointer and use the return value instead.\nData Types\nThere are two different data types used to store the date and time: time_t for timestamps and struct tm for datetime structures.\nTimestamps represent a moment in time as a single number, which makes it easier for the computer to do calculations.\nDatetime structures are structures that represent different components of the date and time as members. This makes it easier for us to specify dates. Datetime structures have the following members:\ntm_sec - The seconds within a minute\ntm_min - The minutes within an hour\ntm_hour - The hour within a day (from 0 to 23)\ntm_mday - The day of the month\ntm_mon - The month (from 0 to 11 starting with January)\ntm_year - The number of years since 1900\ntm_wday - The weekday (from 0 to 6 starting with Sunday)\ntm_yday - The day of the year (from 0 to 365 with 0 being January 1)\ntm_isdst - Positive when daylight saving time is in effect, zero when not in effect and negative when unknown\nAlways keep in mind the way that date components are represented:\nHours are represented in 24-hour format. 11pm would be represented as 23.\nThe months go from 0 to 11. For example, December would be represented as 11 rather than 12.\nYears are represented relative to the year 1900. The year 2024 would be represented as 124 because 124 years have passed since 1900.\nCreating Timestamps\nThe time() function can only create a timestamp for the current date, but we can create a timestamp for any date by using the mktime() function.\nThe mktime() function converts a datetime structure into a timestamp.\nExample\nCreate a timestamp using the mktime() function:\nNote: The mktime() function needs these members to have a value: tm_year, tm_mon, tm_mday, tm_hour, tm_min, tm_sec and tm_isdst.\nCreating Datetime Structures\nThe mktime() function also fills in the tm_wday and tm_yday members of the datetime structure with the correct values, which completes the structure and gives a valid datetime. It can be used, for example, to find the weekday of a given date:\nExample\nFind the weekday of a specified date:\nThe localtime() and gmtime() functions can convert timestamps into datetime structures.\nThe localtime() function returns a pointer to a structure representing the time in the computer's time zone.\nThe gmtime() function returns a pointer to a structure representing the time in the GMT time zone.\nThese functions return a pointer to a datetime structure. If we want to make sure its value does not change unexpectedly we should make a copy of it by dereferencing the pointer. To learn about dereferencing, see the C++ Dereference tutorial.\nExample\nGet a datetime structure and output the current hour:\nREMOVE ADS\nDisplay Dates\nSo far we have been using the ctime() function to display the date contained in a timestamp. To display dates from a datetime structure we can use the asctime() function.\nExample\nDisplay the date represented by a datetime structure:\nNote: The asctime() function does not correct invalid dates. For example, if you set the day of the month to 32 it will display 32. The mktime() function can correct these kinds of errors:\nExample\nCorrect a date before displaying it:\nThe ctime() and asctime() functions allow us to display the date but they do not allow us to choose how it is displayed.\nTo choose how a date is displayed we can use the strftime() function.\nExample\nRepresent the current date in different ways:\nThe strftime() function formats a date and writes it as a C-style string into a char array. It has four parameters:\nThe first parameter points to the char array where the formatted date will be written.\nThe second parameter specifies the space available in the array.\nThe third parameter allows us to choose how the date is formatted using format specifiers.\nThe last parameter is a pointer to the datetime structure which contains the date we want to display.\nThe following table has some useful format specifiers. For a more complete list, look at the strftime() reference page.\nMeasuring Time\nThere are two different functions that can be used to measure differences in time.\nThe difftime() function measures the number of seconds that passed between two different time stamps. This is useful when measuring time differences between dates.\nExample\nMeasure the time difference between two timestamps\nThe clock() function is useful for measuring short intervals of time while the program is running. It is more precise than the difftime() function.\nEach call to the clock function returns a special kind of timestamp measured in clocks (a unit of time that depends on how the library was implemented) which has a data type clock_t. To measure a time difference, store a timestamp at two different moments in time and then subtract them. The time difference is measured in clocks, but you can convert it into seconds by dividing it by the CLOCKS_PER_SEC constant.\nExample\nMeasure how long it takes for the program to run:\nNote: Make sure to cast the value to a float or double type before dividing, otherwise it may result in an integer division which would cause the decimal part to be cut off.\nComplete <ctime> Reference\nFor a complete reference of <ctime> functions, go to our C++ ctime Reference.",

      "summary": "Exceptions\nAs mentioned in the C++ Errors chapter, different types of errors can occur while running a program - such as coding mistakes, invalid input, or unexpected situations.\nWhen an error occurs, C++ will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: C++ will throw an exception (throw an error).\nException Handling (try and catch)\nException handling lets you catch and handle errors during runtime - so your program doesn't crash.\nIt uses three keywords:\ntry - defines the code to test\nthrow - triggers an exception\ncatch - handles the error\nExample\nHere, the program throws an exception with the value 505, which is caught and handled in the catch block.\nReal-Life Example: Age Check\nWe can use exception handling to check if a user is old enough:\nExample\nWe use the try block to test some code: If the age variable is less than 18, we will throw an exception, and handle it in our catch block.\nIn the catch block, we catch the error and do something about it. The catch statement takes a parameter: in our example we use an int variable (myNum) (because we are throwing an exception of int type in the try block (age)), to output the value of age.\nIf no error occurs (e.g. if age is 20 instead of 15, meaning it will be be greater than 18), the catch block is skipped:\nExample\nYou can also use the throw keyword to output a reference number, like a custom error number/code for organizing purposes (505 in our example):\nExample\nHandle Any Type of Exceptions (...)\nIf you do not know the throw type used in the try block, you can use the \"three dots\" syntax (...) inside the catch block, which will handle any type of exception:\nExample",

A vector however, can grow or shrink in size as needed.\nTo use a vector, you have to include the <vector> header file:\nCreate a Vector\nTo create a vector, use the vector keyword, and specify the type of values it should store within angle brackets <> and then the name of the vector, like: vector<type> vectorName.\nExample\nIf you want to add elements at the time of declaration, place them in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces {}, just like with arrays:\nExample\nNote: The type of the vector (string in our example) cannot be changed after its been declared.\nAccess a Vector\nYou can access a vector element by referring to the index number inside square brackets [].\nVectors, like arrays, are 0-indexed, meaning that [0] is the first element, [1] is the second element, and so on:\nExample\nOne advantage of using the vector library, is that it includes many useful functions. For example, you can access the first or the last element of a vector with the .front() and .back() functions:\nExample\nTo access an element at a specified index, you can use the .at() function and specify the index number:\nExample\nNote: The .at() function is often preferred over square brackets [] because it lets you know if an error occurs.\nFor example if the element is out of range:\nExample\nREMOVE ADS\nChange a Vector Element\nTo change the value of a specific element, you can refer to the index number:\nExample\nHowever, it is safer to use the .at() function:\nExample\nAdd Vector Elements\nThe biggest difference between a vector and an array is that vectors can grow dynamically. That means you can add or remove elements from the vector.\nTo add an element to the vector, you can use the .push_back() function, which will add an element at the end of the vector:\nExample\nYou can add as many elements as you want:\nExample\nRemove Vector Elements\nTo remove an element from the vector, you can use the .pop_back() function, which removes an element from the end of the vector:\nExample\nNote: Elements are usually only added and removed from the end of the vector. If you need to add or remove elements from both ends, it is often better to use a deque instead of a vector.\nVector Size\nTo find out how many elements a vector has, use the .size() function:\nExample\nCheck if a Vector is Empty\nThere is also a function to find out whether a vector is empty or not.\nThe .empty() function returns 1 (true) if the vector is empty and 0 (false) if it contains one or more elements:\nExample\nExample\nLoop Through a Vector\nYou can loop through the vector elements by using a for loop combined with the .size() function:\nExample\nYou can also use a for-each loop (introduced in C++ version 11 (2011), which is cleaner and more readable:\nExample\nTip: It is also possible to loop through vectors with an iterator, which you will learn more about in a later chapter.\nComplete Vector Reference\nFor a complete reference of Vector functions, go to our C++ Vector Reference.",

      "summary": "C++ Map\nA map stores elements in \"key/value\" pairs.\nElements in a map are:\nAccessible by keys (not index), and each key is unique.\nAutomatically sorted in ascending order by their keys.\nTo use a map, you have to include the <map> header file:\nCreate a Map\nTo create a map, use the map keyword, and specify the type of both the key and the value it should store within angle brackets <>. At last, specify the name of the map, like: map<keytype, valuetype> mapName:\nExample\nIf you want to add elements at the time of declaration, place them in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces {}:\nExample\nAccess a Map\nYou cannot access map elements by referring to index numbers, like you would with arrays and vectors.\nInstead, you can access a map element by referring to its key inside square brackets []:\nExample\nYou can also access elements with the .at() function:\nExample\nNote: The .at() function is often preferred over square brackets [] because it throws an error message if the element does not exist:\nExample\nREMOVE ADS\nChange Values\nYou can also change the value associated with a key:\nExample\nHowever, it is safer to use the .at() function:\nExample\nAdd Elements\nTo add elements to a map, it is ok to use square brackets []:\nExample\nBut you can also use the .insert() function:\nExample\nElements with Equal Keys\nA map cannot have elements with equal keys.\nFor example, if we try to add \"Jenny\" two times to the map, it will only keep the first one:\nExample\nTo sum up; values can be equal, but keys must be unique.\nRemove Elements\nTo remove specific elements from a map, you can use the .erase() function:\nExample\nTo remove all elements from a map, you can use the .clear() function:\nExample\nFind the Size of a Map\nTo find out how many elements a map has, use the .size() function:\nExample\nCheck if a Map is Empty\nUse the .empty() function to find out if a map is empty or not.\nThe .empty() function returns 1 (true) if the map is empty and 0 (false) otherwise:\nExample\nExample\nNote: You can also check if a specific element exists, by using the .count(key) function.\nIt returns 1 (true) if the element exists and 0 (false) otherwise:\nExample\nLoop Through a Map\nYou can loop through a map with the for-each loop. However, there are a couple of things to be aware of:\nYou should use the auto keyword (introduced in C++ version 11) inside the for loop. This allows the compiler to automatically determine the correct data type for each key-value pair.\nSince map elements consist of both keys and values, you have to include .first to access the keys, and .second to access values in the loop.\nElements in the map are sorted automatically in ascending order by their keys:\nExample\nThe output will be:\nIf you want to reverse the order, you can use the greater<type> functor inside the angle brackets, like this:\nExample\nThe output will be:\nTip: It is also possible to loop through maps with an iterator, which you will learn more about in the next chapter.",

      "title": "C++ Iterator",
      "summary": "C++ Iterators\nIterators are used to access and iterate through elements of data structures (vectors, sets, etc.), by \"pointing\" to them.\nIt is called an \"iterator\" because \"iterating\" is the technical term for looping.\nTo iterate through a vector, look at the following example:\nExample\nFirst we create a vector of strings to store the names of different car manufactures.\nThen we create a \"vector iterator\" called it, that we will use to loop through the vector.\nNext, we use a for loop to loop through the vector with the iterator. The iterator (it) points to the first element in the vector (cars.begin()) and the loop continues as long as it is not equal to cars.end().\nThe increment operator (++it) moves the iterator to the next element in the vector.\nThe dereference operator (*it) accesses the element the iterator points to.\nNote: The type of the iterator must match the type of the data structure it should iterate through (string in our example)\nWhat is begin() and end()?\nbegin() and end() are functions that belong to data structures, such as vectors and lists. They do not belong to the iterator itself. Instead, they are used with iterators to access and iterate through the elements of these data structures.\nbegin() returns an iterator that points to the first element of the data structure.\nend() returns an iterator that points to one position after the last element.\nTo understand how they work, let's continue to use vectors as an example:\nBegin Examples\nbegin() points to the first element in the vector (index 0, which is \"Volvo\"):\nExample\nTo point to the second element (BMW), you can write cars.begin() + 1:\nExample\nAnd of course, that also means you can point to the third element with cars.begin() + 2:\nExample\nEnd Example\nend() points to one position after the last element in the vector (meaning it doesn't point to an actual element, but rather indicates that this is the end of the vector).\nSo, to use end() to point to the last element in the cars vector (Mazda), you can use cars.end() - 1:\nExample\nWhy do we say \"point\"?\nIterators are like \"pointers\" in that they \"point\" to elements in a data structure rather than returning values from them. They refer to a specific position, providing a way to access and modify the value when needed, without making a copy of it. For example:\nExample\nThe auto Keyword\nIn C++ 11 and later versions, you can use the auto keyword instead of explicitly declaring and specifying the type of the iterator.\nThe auto keyword allows the compiler to automatically determine the correct data type, which simplifies the code and makes it more readable:\nInstead of this:\nYou can simply write this:\nIn the example above, the compiler knows the type of it based on the return type of cars.begin(), which is vector<string>::iterator.\nThe auto keyword works in for loops as well:\nREMOVE ADS\nFor-Each Loop vs. Iterators\nYou can use a for-each loop to just loop through elements of a data structure, like this:\nExample\nWhen you are just reading the elements, and don't need to modify them, the for-each loop is much simpler and cleaner than iterators.\nHowever, when you need to add, modify, or remove elements during iteration, iterate in reverse, or skip elements, you should use iterators:\nExample\nIterate in Reverse\nTo iterate in reverse order, you can use rbegin() and rend() instead of begin() and end():\nExample\nIterate Through other Data Structures\nIterators are great for code reusability since you can use the same syntax for iterating through vectors, lists, deques, sets and maps:\nList Example\nDeque Example\nSet Example\nMap Example\nThe examples above shows how to iterate through different data structures that support iterators (vector, list, deque, map and set support iterators, while stacks and queues do not).\nAlgorithms\nAnother important feature of iterators is that they are used with different algorithm functions, such as sort() and find() (found in the <algorithm> library), to sort and search for elements in a data structure.\nFor example, the sort() function takes iterators (typically returned by begin() and end()) as parameters to sort elements in a data structure from the beginning to the end.\nIn this example, the elements are sorted alphabetically since they are strings:\nExample\nAnd in this example, the elements are sorted numerically since they are integers:\nExample\nTo reverse the order, you can use rbegin() and rend() instead of begin() and end():\nExample",

It helps you avoid naming conflicts when your code grows or when you use code from multiple sources.\nThink of a namespace like a folder: you can have a variable named x in two different folders, and they won't clash.\nWhy Use Namespaces?\nTo avoid name conflicts, especially in larger projects\nTo organize code into logical groups\nTo separate your code from code in libraries\nBasic Namespace Example\nHere we define a variable called x inside a namespace called MyNamespace:\nWe use MyNamespace::x to access the variable inside the namespace.\nThe using namespace Keyword\nIf you don't want to write the namespace name every time you access the variable, you can use the using keyword:\nHowever, be careful: In large programs, using using namespace can cause name conflicts. It's often better to use the full name like MyNamespace::x instead.\nThe std Namespace\nIn C++, things like cout, cin, and endl belong to the Standard Library.\nThese are all part of a namespace called std, which stands for standard. That means you normally have to write std::cout, std::cin, and so on.\nTo make your code shorter, you can add:\nYou must type std:: before cout.\nNow you can use cout without writing std:: every time.\nShould You Always Use It?\nFor small programs and learning, using namespace std is fine.\nBut in large projects, it is better to write std:: before each item.
